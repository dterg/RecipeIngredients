Okay, so today I'm here with Maureen and Bria--my client Maureen and her daughter, she's 10 years old.<s>
Maureen is 38.<s>
And so we're gonna be doing kale chips, cacao kale chips.<s>
This was my little phenomenal recipe that I developed.<s>
They're just grabbing two bunches of kale chips--raw, organic kale.<s>
And taking off the leafs, putting it in here.<s>
So I'm gonna let them work away at that.<s>
So kale is a super food.<s>
You know, people always ask, "What's a super food?<s>
" There isn't one super food, but this is definitely a very nutritious food, and it's got a lot of phytonutrients, disease-fighting properties, which is what we want.<s>
So cacao kale chips, again, two bunches of kale, you've got coconut oil.<s>
And again, another oil of your choice.<s>
You can do, even, an almond oil if you want.<s>
I have almond meal, as well.<s>
Then I have some stevia and organic cacao powder that we're gonna be mixing in.<s>
So with kale chips, a lot of times I see people on social media posting, you know, that they put them in their oven, put them at 350.<s>
That is a choice for you, you can do that for about 10 or 15 minutes.<s>
However, I'm gonna tell you the importance of why getting a dehydrator is actually gonna help with getting those nutrients in.<s>
So I have my Excalibur with me, which Santa brought to me 2 years ago.<s>
And thankful for that.<s>
The importance of a dehydrator is it doesn't kill the enzymes.<s>
And the enzymes are so important because it keeps the nutrients alive.<s>
The whole reason we're eating vegetables is because of the powerhouse foods that they are.<s>
So when you're cooking them above a certain level, you're actually killing all the nutrients.<s>
So again, I'm 40 years old, I didn't have all these tools when I was in my 20s or 30s, so it's, you know, over time I've made an investment in certain pieces of equipment that have actually helped my kitchen and the foods I eat work better for me.<s>
So, Maureen, how do you incorporate kale for your family?<s>
Well, for Bria I put it on her sandwich for school for her lunch.<s>
And at home, just for dinner instead of lettuce, or I even mix it with other types of lettuce, spinach or mustard greens.<s>
And we can have it in a salad, we can have it with turkey burger, chicken.<s>
That sounds good.<s>
I'm gonna have to get some recipes from you.<s>
Okay, so Bria, do you like kale.<s>
Yeah.<s>
You don't, like, throw it in the garbage 'cause you're at school and Mom can't see that you're not eating it?<s>
No, I eat it in my sandwich.<s>
Very good, very good.<s>
So there you have it, a great way to get kale in for your kids to enjoy it.<s>
So let's go ahead, if you wanna go ahead and grab the other ingredients here.<s>
Let's get the almond meal in here.<s>
I'm gonna help these guys while they're going ahead and getting off all the leafs.<s>
So again, I'm putting in a couple tablespoons here.<s>
So, like I said, measuring great, but overtime, you know, an extra tablespoon or 2, it's not gonna hurt you.<s>
You wanna put some stevia?<s>
Go ahead and sprinkle that in.<s>
So again, some stevia to taste.<s>
And then I've got the cacao powder.<s>
So again, if you love chocolate, it's great.<s>
And then I'm gonna go ahead and pour the oil in.<s>
Again, you can measure and do a couple tablespoons, but again I want all that powder to stick.<s>
Three people making kale chips.<s>
This is a good workout for the arms.<s>
Okay.<s>
We good?<s>
Awesome.<s>
So here, I love these mixing bowls, they're my favorite.<s>
Okay, who wants to shake it up?<s>
You're the dancing queen, let's go.<s>
Shake it up.<s>
There we go!<s>
Fun in the kitchen with Bria and Maureen.<s>
So, when they're done, you're gonna see, like I said, you can put 'em in the oven.<s>
And I'm gonna have you scoot forward here.<s>
So why don't you go ahead, open that up, let them see.<s>
So this is how they look.<s>
And you can kind of mix it up a little bit more.<s>
But when they're done, they're nice and crispy.<s>
And a crunch--they're so good.<s>
So good.<s>
Go ahead, grab one.<s>
Delicious.<s>
So thanks for joining us on "Nicole's Healthy Minutes.<s>
