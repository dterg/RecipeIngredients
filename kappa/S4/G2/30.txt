This is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.<s>
Today I am going to show you how you can make Ro-Tel Cheese Dip in two different ways.<s>
This is one of my favorite party foods to make.<s>
It is easy and tastes great.<s>
Again, I said this is easy.<s>
This only has two ingredients; the first being Velveeta cheese and the next being a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes.<s>
Now the ratio is easy, easy to remember, it's one pound of Velveeta cheese to one can of Ro-Tel tomatoes.<s>
Now I like to heat mine up on the stove, just because I think it's easier than pulling it in and out of the microwave, and stirring it and trying to make sure it's all perfectly melted.<s>
This takes only about three to five minutes, and you will have some perfectly made Ro-Tel dip.<s>
So again, there it was.<s>
That took me about three to five minutes to make, and now I'm going to spoon this up and put it in a dish and get it ready.<s>
So but you know what?<s>
While this is really good, we can make this Ro-Tel Cheese Dip better.<s>
So I'm going to show you how you can jazz up your Ro-Tel cheese dip; sausage.<s>
You're going to brown a pound of sausage, so go ahead, and cook that thoroughly, because we are going to put this into our cheese sauce, so you want to make sure it is completely browned all the way through.<s>
So again, I'm starting out with that same pot of Ro-Tel dip and that is one pound of Velveeta to two cans of Ro-Tel.<s>
I'm adding in sour cream, cream cheese and the next ingredient I am going to add in is that sausage.<s>
That cooked sausage is going to go in here, as well.<s>
Now for the exact ingredients and recipe, please go to my website.<s>
It's there I list it for you.<s>
A little bit of garlic powder, and then I'm going to go ahead and stir this together a little bit, before I put in my pickled jalapeno slices.<s>
I like to use the pickled ones, simply because they're not as raw-tasting, and I think the heat's a little bit more consistent.<s>
So if you like your cheese dip a little spicier, hey, add some more or even add some of that jalapeno pickle juice.<s>
You can see how that's rich and creamy and full of goodies, so hey, there's Ro-Tel Cheese Dip two different ways.<s>
