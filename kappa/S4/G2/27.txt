Hi, I’m Eugenie.<s>
Today I’m so excited because I’m making a delicious dish, Jjangjangmyun,  which is one of the most popular Korean dishes.<s>
It’s a Koeanized Chinese dish.<s>
For this recipe you will need:  pork, black bean paste, potato, onion, zucchini, vegetable oil, sugar,  cornstarch or potato starch, minced garlic, and oyster sauce.<s>
First, heat a large deep frying pan over medium high heat.<s>
And add in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil,  today I’m using grape seed oil.<s>
And add in 2 garlic cloves, minced.<s>
Then add in 5 ounces of pork.<s>
Normally pork is used for jjajangmyun, and I am using pork tender-loin.<s>
And season with salt and pepper.<s>
And cook for about 4 minutes.<s>
Then add in 1 medium potato, diced.<s>
I’m adding in potato first because it should be cooked thoroughly.<s>
And cook for about 3 minutes.<s>
And 1 medium onions, roughly chopped.<s>
I know it’s a lot of onion.<s>
Jjangjangmyun at restaurants has a lot of onions.<s>
But of course adjust the amount as you like.<s>
And 1/3 medium zucchini, diced.<s>
Then stir fry for another 3 minutes.<s>
And make a hole in the center of the frying pan.<s>
And I will add in 3 tablespoons of chunjang, black bean paste.<s>
Without black bean paste, you cannot make jjajangmyon.<s>
3 tablespoons.<s>
And 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of sugar.<s>
And stir to fry making a little circle for about 2 minutes.<s>
This is very important because Jjangjang means fried sauce in Chinese.<s>
And mix all together until the veggies are well covered.<s>
Hm, it smells good.<s>
The fried sauce.<s>
Then add in 1 and 1/3 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of oyster sauce.<s>
Oyster sauce will give rich flavor to jjajang.<s>
And bring it to a boil.<s>
And in a cup,  add in 2 tablespoons of cornstarch  and the 2 tablespoons of water  and mix all togther until well mixed.<s>
Don’t add the cornstarch directly to the pan, it won’t dissolve very well.<s>
Ok, Now add in the boiling jjajang sauce.<s>
And bring it to a boil  And reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened.<s>
And now for the noodle.<s>
Cook fresh noodle according to the package directions.<s>
Any noodles will do but fresh Chinese style noodle is the best for Jjangjangmyun.<s>
And if you want Jjangjangbop, just serve with rice instead of noodle.<s>
And drain the noodle and wash with cold water.<s>
Be careful because it’s very hot.<s>
Voila!<s>
And sauce.<s>
Jjajangmyon.<s>
The noodle with hot jjajang sauce.<s>
Jjajangmyon is better with cucumber, danmuji, onions, and vinegar.<s>
Bon appetit.<s>
This is why I love fresh noodle.<s>
And black bean sauce is really intense and bold.<s>
This is absolutely a must dish for Korean food lovers and curious people.<s>
And I have many delicious Korean recipes in my “foods in Korea” playlist.<s>
Thank you for watching.<s>
See you soon.<s>
Bye.<s>
