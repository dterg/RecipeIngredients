Hi, I'm Eugenie.<s>
Do you eat rainbows?<s>
Today I'm making rainbow sushi rice cake.<s>
It's totally healthy and very yummy.<s>
If you make savory cakes, try this.<s>
For this recipe you will need:  cooked short-grain rice,  rice vinegar,  optional sesame seeds,  mayonnaise,  canned tuna,  salt, sugar, onion,  pepper, red bell pepper, carrot,  boiled eggs, broccoli, and red cabbage.<s>
First, in a mixing bowl I’m adding 6 ounces of drained canned tuna,  1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion,  and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise.<s>
And mix to combine.<s>
This is for rice cake filling.<s>
And season with pepper.<s>
You can use crab or salmon salad.<s>
If you are vegetarian, how about guacamole?<s>
In 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar,  add 1 tablespoon of sugar  and 1 teaspoon of salt.<s>
And stir to combine.<s>
And pour it into the cooked short-grain rice and fold to mix.<s>
Be careful not to break rice.<s>
I cooked 2 cups of rice today.<s>
And if you want, now mixing in toasted sesame seeds would be great.<s>
Then equally divide the rice in 5.<s>
And add one vegetable in each bowl:  3 tablespoons of finely chopped red bell pepper,  3 tablespoons of finely chopped carrots,  crumbles of 3 boiled egg yolks,  3 tablespoons of finely chopped broccoli,  and 3 tablespoons of finely chopped red cabbage.<s>
I used blanched broccoli, carrot, and red cabbage for better taste, digestion, and color.<s>
And mix well.<s>
For vegetarians, how about yellow bell pepper or yellow pickled radish for yellow rice?<s>
Any other ideas?<s>

Then for a rainbow cup, make a rainbow in a glass.<s>
First, violet.<s>
And I will add tuna salad between layers.<s>
Then green,  yellow,  press down a little with a spoon to make it firm.<s>
orange,  and red.<s>
And for sushi rice cake, make another rainbow in a cup lined with plastic wrap.<s>
This time I started with red.<s>
And repeat the process.<s>
Voila, Healthy rainbow cup.<s>
And rainbow sushi rice cake.<s>
Aren’t they beautiful?<s>
The colors of this dish is  so inviting.<s>
Bon appetit.<s>
