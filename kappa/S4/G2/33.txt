Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I've got a new variation on potato salad for you.<s>
It's a spicy potato salad, because I posted it on Instagram and a lot of people were like hey, I want to know how to make that.<s>
So, I'm going to show you just in time for the weekend for all of you who are cooking and grilling out some stuff that you're not even inviting me to, you jerks.<s>
Okay.<s>
For the potato salad I've got some potatoes.<s>
They're in the pot.<s>
I already boiled them.<s>
I'm pretty sure you can figure out how to do that.<s>
Meanwhile, we're going to make this dressing.<s>
I've got some mayonnaise in here.<s>
If you don't want to use mayonnaise you can use sour cream.<s>
I'm going to add some apple cider vinegar.<s>
This is one of my favorite vinegars, and I like to get the one that's unpasteurized because it's got a lot of really good probiotics in it.<s>
That means that it's good for your intestines.<s>
A little bit of olive oil and some mustard.<s>
This is a fun little mustard that Suzanne sent me from Germany, and it's got pink peppercorns and green peppercorns in it.<s>
If you can't find this, which I've never seen it in the US so I wouldn't be surprised, you can just use some kind of brown deli mustard.<s>
It would be very similar.<s>
About a tablespoon of that.<s>
Because this is spicy we're going to add some chili powder.<s>
This is just ground New Mexico chili powder without any additional stuff in it.<s>
Good, hefty dose of that.<s>
It's not terribly spicy, but it's got a nice earthy flavor.<s>
Then, for the spice, a little bit of cayenne, and that's optional.<s>
Leave it up to your taste.<s>
That was a few dashes.<s>
Some black pepper.<s>
This has got multiple types of peppers in it.<s>
Super fun.<s>
Some salt.<s>
We'll get this whisked together.<s>
Okay.<s>
We can set that aside and cut up our potatoes.<s>
I boiled some red fingerling potatoes.<s>
That's fingerling, gentlemen.<s>
I'm going to leave the skins on.<s>
You could use some red new potatoes or something like that, too, or some white potatoes.<s>
White, or red, or Yukon gold, those are all really nice for potato salad.<s>
Let's see, maybe cut them lengthwise, just basically bite-size pieces.<s>
It's best to dress the potatoes, mix it up with the dressing while the potatoes are still a little bit warm, because that way they'll absorb more of the flavors from the dressing.<s>
Once the potatoes are in there we've got some celery.<s>
You can cut this up any old size you want to.<s>
I like to cut them lengthwise and then in sort of smallish squares.<s>
Add that to the bowl, then I'm going to add some red onion that I've diced up.<s>
I tried to kind of keep all the vegetables except the celery red.<s>
Get it?<s>
Because spicy, red, devils, cupids.<s>
Okay.<s>
Some fresh red bell pepper.<s>
These are peppadew peppers which look like cherry peppers but they're not really very spicy at all.<s>
They're usually packed in kind of a sweetish brine.<s>
They've got a nice flavor profile.<s>
It's pretty complex.<s>
You can buy them in a jar, or if your grocery store has one of those, like, fancy olive bars they're usually also there.<s>
I've got a couple of those.<s>
You could totally use some cherry peppers instead, although they're going to be hotter than these, so keep that in mind.<s>
Or, sometimes you can even find pickled red jalapenos.<s>
Perfect, that's all in there.<s>
Then, stir it around.<s>
This spoon is ridiculously small for this job.<s>
What am I, an idiot?<s>
Don't answer that.<s>
Here we go.<s>
To me this kind of potato salad with the spiciness and the extra vinegar goes really, really well with grilled meats and barbecue, heavy meats like beef brisket or lamb.<s>
There we go.<s>
There's our spicy potato salad.<s>
If you like this recipe be sure to check out the Greek pasta salad recipe that I just made last week.<s>
Also, check out hilahcooking.com.<s>
You can get this printable recipe, and also I posted a grilled lamb recipe that would be superb alongside this potato salad.<s>
Try that this weekend, send me a picture of what you made, and I will love you forever, with my clothes on.<s>
Did I go out of frame?<s>
Sorry.<s>
That's delicious.<s>
It's tangy and refreshing and spicy, and I love it, and I hope you try it.<s>
I think you're really going to like it.<s>
Thanks so much for watching.<s>
Please don't forget to subscribe, and I'll see you later.<s>
Bye.<s>
