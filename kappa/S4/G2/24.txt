Hilah: Hey dudes.<s>
I'm Hilah.<s>
Welcome to Hilah Cooking.<s>
Today, I have a very special guest who is the pizza expert and he's going to show you how to make homemade pizza at home.<s>
All right, so here's Brandon and him and his brother are from Detroit.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: And you all just started a pizza trailer called Via 313.<s>
Brandon: Correct.<s>
Hilah: Because 313 is Detroit's original area code.<s>
Brandon: That's so smart.<s>
Hilah: Good.<s>
All right, so we're going to make pizza today.<s>
You all specialize in Detroit style, so tell me about that.<s>
Brandon: Well, Detroit style is made with blue steel pans to make on a Sicilian styled pie, but we put the sauce on top, caramelized cheese all the way around, and we get four squares out of it.<s>
Hilah: God, sounds yummy as hell.<s>
Brandon: And it's so good.<s>
Hilah: All right, but I don't have a pizza pan.<s>
What do we do?<s>
Brandon: We're just going to make it happen with what we got in the kitchen.<s>
Hilah: Sweet!<s>
I love that.<s>
Awesome, let's make some dough.<s>
Brandon: All right.<s>
Hilah: All right, so we got just a few ingredients here.<s>
It's not like it's that complicated it seems like.<s>
Brandon: It's pretty easy.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
So you all do use bread flour.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: That's the key thing, right?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, a lot better than all-purpose flour.<s>
Most people buy all- purpose flour and you don't get the same rise out of the dough.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
And then we've got some dry yeast.<s>
Now is this what you all use in .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: In the trailer we use active dry yeast, but at home instant dry yeast is a little bit better.<s>
It's a little user friendly.<s>
Hilah: Okay, all right.<s>
So this recipe is a little modified from what they actually do so that we can make homemade pizza at home.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
So I've got my stand mixer here and I've got a bread hook on this so we can use this for kneading.<s>
If people don't have that, they can't just knead it by hand I guess.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, be old school like that.<s>
Hilah: Where did I get muscles?<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: So we're just going to put all this stuff in and turn on the thingy.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, that's pretty easy.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
So we got our yeast and we're going to put it in with the flour.<s>
Stop me when I hook up.<s>
Brandon: I'll slap the shit out of you.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
Salt and sugar.<s>
And then .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: So far.<s>
Hilah: So far, so good.<s>
Brandon: So far.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
And then oil in there too?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, did all right so far.<s>
Hilah: Thanks professor.<s>
Okay, and then I'm going to put this in here.<s>
Okay, and then what is it?<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: And turn this on?<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: Okay, so this .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Well, now it'll just go and it'll start to kind of like .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, it'll start to ball up and you'll be able to tell once it becomes one .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
etc.<s>
It's very loose right now obviously.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
So we'll just let it go for a few minutes and then we'll come back and take a look at it.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I would say five to six minutes is pretty standard.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Yeah, it's already changing, cool.<s>
Okay.<s>
So it's been like five minutes or something.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Look at that.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, it should be nice on the hands.<s>
It shouldn't stick to your fingers too bad.<s>
If it does, just throw some more flour in there.<s>
Hilah: Yeah, we added maybe a couple extra teaspoons I guess.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, just make it easy to handle for yourself.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Now we've got some flour on our bitch as they call it in the restaurant.<s>
Brandon: Yes, bitch flour.<s>
Yes, that's the fancy words for it.<s>
Hilah: It's just flour on the counter top.<s>
Brandon: This recipe should make enough for five or six pizzas.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: You can cut it.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Hilah: Pizza party!<s>
So I'll do six.<s>
Brandon: Make it four.<s>
Hilah: Make it four, okay.<s>
Brandon: So it'll be a little bit thicker.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Wow, it cuts really nice.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, it's got a nice feel to it.<s>
Hilah: And then what do you just kind of .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Well, you can ball it like this.<s>
Pull it over like that.<s>
You pull the sides and I'll pinch it at the bottom, and then make sure you cap it like that.<s>
That's what they call it.<s>
Hilah: Kind of like pinch it.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, and then the other nice restaurant ball.<s>
Hilah: Ooh!<s>
Cutsie tootsie.<s>
Brandon: You do another one.<s>
I'll do another one.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: I think yours actually looks nicer than mine.<s>
Hilah: I'm a girl.<s>
Brandon: That's what happens.<s>
Hilah: So then we'll put these in the fridge and that's an important thing that you all make sure to let it kind of rest over time.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I like to give it a good 12 or 24 hours to rest, gives it a nice flavor.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool, so start this a day ahead people.<s>
Brandon: Yes, plan ahead.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Well, this one's not quite as pretty.<s>
Let's use this one.<s>
It's the prettiest.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, thank you.<s>
I did that.<s>
Hilah: I noticed.<s>
And then I'll just kind of, I guess, a little oil in here.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, throw a little oil in there so it doesn't still too bad and it'll be easier to handle tomorrow.<s>
It won't .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: Stick to the .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
And keep it from getting like a dry out skin here.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, obviously covering it so it won't dry out too bad, but Hilah: All right.<s>
So then we'll put this in the fridge and then I'll get you back here tomorrow.<s>
Brandon: I'll meet you tomorrow.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
Brandon: Maybe, I don't know.<s>
Hilah: Well, if you're not drunk.<s>
Okay, so here we are again.<s>
Nice outfit.<s>
Brandon: Thank you.<s>
Hilah: He did not spend the night here.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
So we got our raised doughs.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, and what you want to do is kind of make love to it.<s>
Don't go in there and bang it all out.<s>
Just the more you mess it up the harder it'll be.<s>
Hilah: Am I messing it up?<s>
Brandon: You're destroying it.<s>
Hilah: Oh, God.<s>
I am.<s>
I'm sorry.<s>
Brandon: There you go.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Because we don't want to like bust all the air out, right?<s>
Brandon: No, well again, the easier it is to handle right here.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: So what you want to do is make a little crust.<s>
So imagine a pizza on your table.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Come on, get with it.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
I was going to watch.<s>
I don't make it.<s>
Brandon: No, make a little crust.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Flip it over.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: And then .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Keep doing it.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Now, flip it over again.<s>
All right.<s>
You can push out the gas in the middle, but don't mess up the crust that you started.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Yours looks better than mine.<s>
Brandon: Now use your knuckles to stretch it.<s>
Just pull it apart and Hilah: Oh!<s>
Brandon: Ah, geez!<s>
Hilah: Party foul.<s>
Pizza party foul.<s>
Brandon: Yes, you can stretch it about [inaudible that.<s>
Put your hand back and stretch it.<s>
Put your hand back, just pull it apart with your knuckles like that.<s>
There you go.<s>
That ain't going to tear on you.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
This pretty cool.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I think this is the most intimidating part that people get a little freaked out about making pizza.<s>
And if it does tear on you, just pinch it together and there you go.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Just patch it?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, just patch it together.<s>
Hilah: You did that on purpose .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: I did that on .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
to show us how to fix it.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, exactly.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: That's what I tell people.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: Keep stretching with your knuckles until you get about a 12 inch pie.<s>
I think yours is pretty good actually.<s>
round.<s>
Brandon: Let's destroy it, so we can be done with it.<s>
Hilah: It's the pizza expert, okay?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I'm done with it and so that's good.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
We just don't need one anyway.<s>
Brandon: That's good, yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Because I'm not hungry.<s>
All right.<s>
We can use that.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
So now we put some toppings on.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, so let's go ahead and put a little flour on this.<s>
Most people don't have these at home.<s>
Hilah: Right.<s>
Brandon: You can use just a cardboard box and throw a little flour on the cart.<s>
I'm not hungry.<s>
Brandon: Geez!<s>
A fucking shit show over here.<s>
So no matter what you do it's going to lose its shape and form.<s>
So once you get it on your cardboard box or if you're fancy and have a [inaudible restructure it to a nice round size.<s>
I won't keep saying pie because most people here in Texas don't call it a pie.<s>
Hilah: Right.<s>
Yankee.<s>
Brandon: There it is.<s>
Hilah: Just kidding.<s>
Welcome Yankee.<s>
Brandon: I don't have ten years underneath from some [inaudible Hilah: Okay.<s>
Wow!<s>
Brandon: That's a good start right there.<s>
Hilah: That looks awesome.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
So we'll get some sauce and cheeses.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I don't know where it's at.<s>
Hilah: Oh, you know what?<s>
I made sauce.<s>
Brandon: Where is it?<s>
There it is.<s>
It's a little easier if you put it in the center.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: I put a pretty good mound in the center all the time and just kind of swirl it out into the crust.<s>
You should be able to see where your crust was.<s>
Hilah: And I can see it on mine, yeah.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, a little bit.<s>
If you have an imagination just make it happen.<s>
Hilah: So we don't want to like saturate it.<s>
Brandon: No, just give it a good .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
And sometimes it's better to put a little bit up at the top because it'll all kind of bleed through the center once it starts baking.<s>
Hilah: Oh, okay.<s>
A little heavier on the edges.<s>
Brandon: So I like to put a little .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Yeah, a little heavier on the edges especially because the crust tends to dry out a little bit.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: And then just let it kind of bleed through, through the center.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: So that's the beautiful saucing.<s>
Hilah: Awesome.<s>
And then the cheesing happens next.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
We got our moz.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, we'll do it together.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: This is a whole milk mozzarella.<s>
It bakes up a little bit nicer.<s>
It's got a little bit higher fat content than like a Kraft, a little moister cheese that you'd get at .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
you know?<s>
Hilah: Like pre-shredded kind of stuff.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, if you want to be cheap.<s>
It's like a buck more a pound, but you'll taste the quality.<s>
It's already got a nice salt content so it'll pull the mozzarella flavor out of it.<s>
Hilah: Yum.<s>
Brandon: Again, kind of the same with the sauce.<s>
With the cheese you want to put a little bit more around the edges.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Not hit the crust, but let it kind of bleed through.<s>
It'll all melt towards the center.<s>
That's pretty good right there.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
So we got our moz, now we get our pepps.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
And this is some kind of .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: These are natural casing pepperonis.<s>
This is what we use back in Michigan and we're trying to bring a little flavor back to Texas from Detroit.<s>
These will shrink up, cup and charr.<s>
We call them grease cups back at home.<s>
Hilah: Mm!<s>
I love that kind.<s>
Brandon: Yes, but you don't find it around here too much though.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: Just whatever you want to do.<s>
Hilah: Just get it on there.<s>
Brandon: Who cares?<s>
Hilah: Jesus.<s>
Brandon: Whatever.<s>
There it is.<s>
Hilah: Show is over.<s>
Brandon: Here.<s>
Just put some so it's not on the crust though.<s>
But for real, these will melt, cook up nice, so whatever.<s>
It doesn't have to be pretty because they'll do their own thing.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
Let's put it in the oven.<s>
Brandon: That's beautiful.<s>
So again, we're using our fancy peel from the restaurant or the trailer.<s>
We have a stone in here.<s>
It's preheated about 550 degrees.<s>
If you give it a good shake, again, if you're using a pizza box at home, you could use a little bit of flour on the box and just kind of give it a good shaking on there, make love to it, and let it do its thing.<s>
It should take about ten minutes and it should be ready to go.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
If people don't have a pizza stone, what can they use?<s>
Brandon: A pizza stone, you can use just a regular aluminum sheet pan.<s>
This cooks up real nicely.<s>
You'll get a nice crisp on the bottom or as you said we could use a cast-iron upside down, make a mini personal pie.<s>
Hilah: A smaller one.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: But stone works the best.<s>
They're only about 15 bucks.<s>
Hilah: Awesome.<s>
Brandon: And a local art shop.<s>
Hilah: Voila!<s>
Awesome.<s>
Okay.<s>
Brandon: Now you're cutting it now so go ahead.<s>
Hilah: I have to cut it?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, cut it in eighths, cut it in half.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Just, you know .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: My girl muscles are tiny.<s>
Brandon: Put those mashed potatoes into it.<s>
Don't do that.<s>
All right.<s>
This is sad.<s>
Brandon: Forget it.<s>
So we'll cut it in half.<s>
Hilah: Let's have a man do it.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: I can't guarantee you get a .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: So not like back and forth and sawing it.<s>
Brandon: No, don't do that because you'll have 18 different pieces out of that.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: So this is what we have here.<s>
Hilah: Cheers.<s>
Brandon: Beautiful, cheers.<s>
Hilah: Yay!<s>
Mm.<s>
Brandon: Everything is good except for the sauce.<s>
I don't know what happened.<s>
Hilah: Oh, my God.<s>
My mom did it.<s>
That was weird.<s>
Brandon: I don't really know what happened with the sauce, but the cheese, the pepperoni, the crust, perfect.<s>
Hilah: Dude!<s>
This is awesome.<s>
Brandon: The sauce is .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: Wow!<s>
Dude, pizza party!<s>
Brandon: You guys can buy Ragu at the store or whatever.<s>
Hilah: He's funny.<s>
Anyway, I'm going to be having a pizza party for my New Years.<s>
What are you going to be doing?<s>
Thanks for coming on the show Brandon, pizza face.<s>
Brandon: Thank you for having me and my beard.<s>
Hilah: No problem.<s>
You should have a beard net really.<s>
There's hair all in my pizza.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, this is a hairy pizza.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
Bye!<s>
Thank you for watching.<s>
Brandon: See you.<s>
Hilah: See you.<s>
Brandon: Warm up.<s>
Man: That's great.<s>
Brandon: All right.<s>
I'm ready.<s>
