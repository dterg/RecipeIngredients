Hi guys, Jillian Beck back with another healthy recipe with Bodybuilding.com.<s>
Today I'm gonna be showing you my lettuce-wrapped turkey muffins.<s>
I know there are a lot of turkey muffin recipes out there.<s>
This is just my version.<s>
It's pretty simple.<s>
It's very versatile so I'm just gonna show you how to put it together, give you some different options, but you can play around with it and we'll get started.<s>
It should take about 25 minutes to make altogether with the baking.<s>
It's gonna be in the oven for 20 minutes at 375 and then it takes about 5 minutes just to throw everything together.<s>
So what you're gonna need is our ground turkey.<s>
I usually go 96% and above.<s>
Right now I think this is 96% lean.<s>
If I'm closer to like a show or a photo shoot, I definitely go leaner, 99% is what I usually go with.<s>
So I got this.<s>
I basically just went through my fridge since we're doing kind of mid-week meal prepping at our house and kind of just grabbed whatever veggies I had in stock.<s>
And so we have some spinach, some bell pepper and some onions and then I usually like to throw in like a fresh herb.<s>
I've done fresh basil, I think that was last week and this week I'm gonna do some fresh cilantro.<s>
So those are the veggies we're gonna use to throw in with the ground turkey.<s>
You'll also need one egg white and then our seasonings.<s>
And I like to use Bragg's liquid aminos.<s>
It's a natural soy sauce alternative.<s>
I go with my staples of seasonings which is garlic, ginger and then a little bit of sea salt and cracked pepper.<s>
And then you'll need some cooking spray for our muffin tin and then some romaine lettuce leaves like for the hearts to wrap the turkey burger or turkey muffins in.<s>
So it's really simple, really easy.<s>
I've got the turkey already in here.<s>
I've chopped our veggies up so I'm just gonna go ahead and add those.<s>
And so you don't have to like stick with the exact veggies that I do.<s>
Definitely play around with what you like and what you have in your fridge at the time.<s>
We're gonna throw that in there.<s>
There's kind of the staples we have around.<s>
If we have some green onion, I like to throw that in there as well.<s>
If I want them spicy, I put in some chili flakes.<s>
These are just gonna be pretty standard and they're just great to have on hand during the week.<s>
You know, for quick lunches, you can break them up and put it over brown rice if you want some carbs.<s>
If we have them for dinner, I usually just wrap them in the romaine lettuce leaves and so they're really good that way.<s>
And then I put some mustard or Walden Farms like barbecue sauce is amazing so I like that as well.<s>
I'm gonna add my one egg white here.<s>
And some turkey muffins call for like quinoa flour or out flour to help bind everything but like I said, mine's pretty simple, basic.<s>
I don't have a ton of ingredients and so it's just egg white, turkey and veggies and I like to keep it simple that way.<s>
So I'm adding these spices and I don't really measure them, but I would say maybe it's like 1 teaspoon, but I just kind of go with eyeballing it since I do this all the time so.<s>
And then for the liquid aminos, I would say 1--let's see here, 1 teaspoon about so.<s>
We'll mix all these ingredients together.<s>
You can get in there with your hands too and really make sure everything is combined well.<s>
I'm just using this wooden spoon here.<s>
It's almost ready.<s>
It's kind of just a different version of the turkey burgers that I make.<s>
So when I want to do turkey burgers like if we're having a barbecue or, you know, and I want to make my own burgers, I'll do turkey burgers with a recipe very similar to this but I'll make patties and I'll grill them up and then wrap them in butter leaf lettuce.<s>
But these muffins are just super easy, especially when you're, you know, in the kitchen so much and doing a lot of meal prep.<s>
So, I just wanted to keep it simple and healthy for you guys.<s>
So that's all mixed.<s>
I'm gonna ahead and spray the muffin tin with this Pam.<s>
Good to go.<s>
I'm gonna use a spoon here too.<s>
I'd say it's like a baseball size for each muffin and we'll just pop that in there.<s>
And so if you want to find out kind of like what your macros for this meal are, definitely what I do is take like two muffins and put it on the scale and kind of measure it out and see what I'm at.<s>
I usually try to go for 3 to 4 ounces of protein and that's usually about 200 calories or less.<s>
I mean it's all just veggies in here so it's not a whole lot of anything else.<s>
So depending on what your macronutrient needs are, you can have two or three, you know, turkey muffins or more than that if you're trying to put on some more size or muscle and you need a higher dose of protein so.<s>
Almost ready here.<s>
And that made perfect 12 muffins.<s>
Put that back on here.<s>
Sit that aside.<s>
My hands are really gross right now so I'm gonna go rinse them real quick.<s>
Okay, so here are our turkey muffins before they go in the oven.<s>
So I'm gonna go ahead and put them in there at 375 for 20 minutes and I will be right back.<s>
All right, guys, so the turkey muffins are done.<s>
They've baked for about 20 minutes at 375 and I went ahead and let them cool off for about 2 minutes or so.<s>
And I've taken out the romaine lettuce hearts and I placed two muffins on there, if you can see them.<s>
And--I guess you can't but they're there.<s>
And I'll go ahead and probably put some spicy mustard on there.<s>
If I'm getting a little crazy with it, I might add some avocado, which will be a really excellent choice, especially for dinner time if you're, you know, omitting like any other carbs and you want to add some extra fats, sliced avocado on these would be excellent.<s>
So yeah, I might do some spicy mustard and avocado, but again it's your choice.<s>
You can add Walden's barbecue sauce.<s>
Some low-sugar ketchup would be good.<s>
So feel free to make it your own.<s>
It's really simple, really quick and delicious.<s>
