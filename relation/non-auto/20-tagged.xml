Hi.<s>
I'm Jamie Eason.<s>
Welcome to the bodybuilding.com kitchen.<s>
Today I'm gonna make my <entity type="Recipe">Pumpkin Protein Bars</entity>.<s>
I know I've been making a whole lot of different types of protein bars, but I don't want you to get burned out so I've got this brand new one.<s>
This one actually makes a larger portion than the 8x8 we've been using so we're gonna get a bigger Pyrex dish this time.<s>
I've prepped this by spraying non-stick spray.<s>
It's a 9x13, and I've also preheated the oven to 350 degrees.<s>
So this one's easy because it's all in one large bowl.<s>
See, first we've got <entity type="Amount">2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cups</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">oat flour</entity>.<s>
Again, <entity type="Ingredient">oat flour</entity> is just ground up oatmeal, and you can buy it at the store in the healthy section.<s>
You can make your own by grinding it in a coffee grinder or in a blender.<s>
So I'm just gonna put that in.<s>
<entity type="Amount">Two</entity> <entity type="Unit">cups</entity>.<s>
And then I've got <entity type="Amount">2</entity> <entity type="Unit">scoops</entity> of a <entity type="Ingredient">vanilla whey protein</entity>.<s>
You can use any flavor that you like.<s>
For me, I just look for the fewer ingredients the better 'cause then it's healthier and usually it tastes a little better too.<s>
So <entity type="Amount">2</entity> <entity type="Unit">scoops</entity> of that.<s>
And then I'm gonna start putting in all of the flavoring ingredients.<s>
I've got <entity type="Amount">2</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoons</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">cinnamon</entity>, <entity type="Amount">1 1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoons</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">ground ginger</entity>, <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">cloves</entity>.<s>
Cloves are pretty strong, but I think that's really what gives this its flavor.<s>
So then we've got <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">baking soda</entity> and <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">baking powder</entity> and then <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">salt</entity>.<s>
For my sweetener, I'm actually adding <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">Xylitol</entity>.<s>
You can use the <entity type="Ingredient">brown sugar blend</entity>.<s>
You can use the regular.<s>
I actually like the <entity type="Ingredient">brown sugar blend</entity> for this recipe a lot, but you can't always find it.<s>
This one is just the regular <entity type="Amount">half</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">Xylitol</entity> so put that in.<s>
I'm gonna mix up these dry ingredients really well.<s>
Okay.<s>
And then to this I'm gonna start adding the wet ingredients.<s>
You can mix these in separate bowls if you like, but it's really not necessary so I'm just gonna put it all right in the same bowl.<s>
First thing, I'm gonna start with <entity type="Amount">four</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity>.<s>
You can use the <entity type="Ingredient">liquid egg whites</entity> if you like.<s>
I used regular, real <entity type="Ingredient">eggs</entity>.<s>
I kinda like those better for baking, but it's up to you.<s>
Then I'm gonna add <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">almond milk</entity>.<s>
You can use whatever kind you want.<s>
You can do regular <entity type="Ingredient">milk</entity>.<s>
You can do <entity type="Ingredient">rice milk</entity>.<s>
Whatever you'd like, but I like the <entity type="Ingredient">almond milk</entity> so <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of that.<s>
And then to that I'm gonna add one <entity type="Amount">4</entity> <entity type="Unit">ounce</entity> of the <entity type="Ingredient">baby food applesauce</entity>.<s>
You can use regular <entity type="Ingredient">unsweetened applesauce</entity> at home if you have that.<s>
Put that in there.<s>
It comes out to probably about <entity type="Amount">1/4</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> if you're gonna us the jar at home.<s>
To that I'm gonna add my <entity type="Ingredient">pumpkin</entity>.<s>
I've used <entity type="Amount">a</entity> whole 15 ounce <entity type="Unit">can</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">pumpkin</entity> for this so you can use as little or as much as you want.<s>
I really like mine really pumpkiny so I use the whole entire can.<s>
Make sure, too, that you pick the raw <entity type="Ingredient">pumpkin</entity> and not the pumpkin pie mix that's loaded with sugar.<s>
So put that in.<s>
Then my final wet ingredient is just <entity type="Amount">2</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoons</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">vanilla</entity>.<s>
So I've got all of those in.<s>
You can use the whisk if you like, but I don't wanna make a mess so I'm just gonna fold it all in with my spatula.<s>
Okay.<s>
Starting to come together.<s>
And for this recipe, you can use <entity type="Ingredient">nuts</entity> or you can do it without nuts.<s>
I'm gonna put <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">walnuts</entity> in it.<s>
I really like <entity type="Ingredient">pumpkin</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">walnut</entity> together.<s>
So I've got it all mixed up.<s>
I've already put <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">walnuts</entity> in a little baggie.<s>
So the reason I've done this is because I didn't buy the crushed up kind.<s>
I'm gonna actually crush these myself.<s>
So I like to buy the ones from the bin.<s>
Usually they're a little bit more fresh than the ones that have been sitting on the shelf for a while.<s>
So I just put them in a bag.<s>
You can grab anything you like.<s>
I like my little rolling pin.<s>
Just sort of crush them a little bit.<s>
If you're worried about adding too much fat to your dessert, you actually don't have to mix them in.<s>
You can put it all together and just maybe sprinkle half on one side or just lightly sprinkle them on top.<s>
I like to mix mine in because I like there to be <entity type="Ingredient">nuts</entity> in every bite, but it's totally up to you.<s>
That's pretty good.<s>
Getting there.<s>
Maybe a little smaller.<s>
Alright.<s>
Now I'll just dump these in.<s>
Now the difference though--if you make it with or without nuts--with <entity type="Ingredient">nuts</entity>, you're looking at probably about 67, 68 calories.<s>
Without nuts, you're looking at under 50.<s>
It's about 47 calories.<s>
So it's totally up to you, but the fat isn't that different and the amount of protein really isn't that different.<s>
It's like about 4 grams of protein a bar.<s>
This makes 24 bars, by the way.<s>
So I've got that all mixed in.<s>
And I'm gonna get my dish ready and just pour it in the pan.<s>
Okay.<s>
I'll get it all spread out.<s>
Now this one you wanna bake it for about 30 minutes I would say, but it's totally up to you.<s>
Some people like the bars a little bit more soft, and some people like them a little more cooked through.<s>
I suggest that if you're traveling with these, definitely keep them in the oven a little bit longer 'cause you want them to hold up.<s>
Put these in the oven.<s>
Bake it for about 30 minutes.<s>
Think that's right.<s>
And then we'll check it in about 30 minutes.<s>
Always make sure when you're baking that your oven rack is like usually in the middle.<s>
If it's too close to the heating element on the bottom, it'll burn.<s>
And if it's too high up, it'll take forever to cook so we will check on it in about 30 minutes.<s>
Alright.<s>
The timer went off.<s>
Let's check our bars.<s>
Alright.<s>
They look good.<s>
I'm pretty sure these are done, but if you wanna make sure you can stick a toothpick in it.<s>
If it comes out dry with no wetness or anything, it's pretty much ready.<s>
So I'm gonna let these cool and then we'll come back, cut them, and I'll show you how to wrap them up.<s>
Okay.<s>
Our <entity type="Recipe">Pumpkin Protein Bars</entity> are fully cooled so I'm gonna cut them up.<s>
Let's see.<s>
We've got--it's gonna make 24 squares so I'm gonna make 3 cuts lengthwise and 5 this way.<s>
Alright.<s>
Scoop a few of these out.<s>
They look really good.<s>
You can see some of the <entity type="Ingredient">nuts</entity> in there.<s>
And then I'm gonna wrap up the rest.<s>
Show you how I wrap them when I travel.<s>
Be sure to store these in a cool place like the frigerator because if you leave them just out on the counter or not in your cooler, they'll actually spoil.<s>
There's no preservatives or anything in these.<s>
I do them by twos.<s>
I just place two on the saran wrap, fold over the one end, and roll it over, and then fold in the edges and--it's pretty simple.<s>
Okay.<s>
I'm gonna finish up wrapping up the rest of these.<s>
