<transcript id="1" title="Breakfast Enchiladas! |  Hilah Cooking " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFUG9ESBhr0" mode="non-automatic">
Hey, dudes.<s>
I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking, we're making breakfast enchiladas filled with potatoes and chorizo, topped with fried eggs with a homemade chili sauce.<s>
These are going to go great with all of your breakfast margaritas.<s>
Alright.<s>
Numero uno.<s>
That means number one in Spanish.<s>
We're going to make our chili sauce.<s>
So, I've got here a couple of dried pasilla chilies.<s>
They're pretty sweet and tasty and delicious.<s>
I'm just going to break the stems off.<s>
I've already given them a little rinse, just to get any dust or pesticide residue or anything like that off of them, since they're not organic.<s>
Sorry, Jesus.<s>
I'm going to add about a cup of water or maybe a little more.<s>
All we're going to do is bring this to a boil.<s>
When it boils, I'm going to turn the heat off and just let it sit for about ten minutes to get reconstituted.<s>
So, I'm actually going to move this to this back burner while that happens.<s>
Do a little magic switcharoo here and work on numero two.<s>
This totally looks like a number two here.<s>
Alright.<s>
What this is is not a turd.<s>
It's some chorizo sausage, some fresh Mexican chorizo sausage.<s>
I'm just going to cook this over sort of a medium-high heat, until it's cooked through and in really fine crumbles.<s>
You could totally leave this out.<s>
I've made these vegetarian before, and they're just delicious.<s>
But I had some chorizo, so I'm going to add it.<s>
[music].<s>
Once most of the fat has released, you can be pretty sure that it's almost cooked.<s>
So, I'm going to add some diced onion.<s>
We just want to soften this a little bit.<s>
I still want to keep some of the crunch integrity of the onion, but maybe not like fully raw onions.<s>
Although, you totally could.<s>
It's also fine that way.<s>
This is a very flexible recipe, as long as you have the chili sauce and the potatoes, and even, you could totally just buy a can of enchilada sauce and make enchiladas and serve them for breakfast with an egg on top.<s>
I don't give two shits.<s>
Okay.<s>
So, our water on the chilies is boiling.<s>
That's great.<s>
I'm going to drop in a couple cloves of raw garlic, just like that.<s>
Bloop.<s>
Put the lid back on it.<s>
Turn it off and just let it sit there for ten minutes to get softened up.<s>
Okay.<s>
Onions are getting just barely translucent.<s>
Go ahead and turn the heat off.<s>
I've got two red potatoes here that I boiled a couple days ago, and then peeled and just cut into pretty big cubes.<s>
And then, I'm also going to add some baby spinach.<s>
Tear it up a little bit.<s>
Ew.<s>
Gross.<s>
I want my money back.<s>
But like I said, yeah, this is totally still a hearty meal if you leave the chorizo out.<s>
The meat is not integral.<s>
I don't know.<s>
Take it out.<s>
It's not necessary for the recipe to work.<s>
Just a little extra bonus, because chorizo is the new bacon, y'all.<s>
I just declared that for 2014.<s>
Pass it on.<s>
Just going to mash up those potato chunks a little bit to help this filling stick together.<s>
That's just going to make it easier to roll up.<s>
Okay.<s>
Them the last thing I'm going to add to the filling is some crumbled up cotija cheese.<s>
This is a Mexican cheese.<s>
It's very firm and salty, kind of reminds me of a merman's dick because it's firm and salty.<s>
Okay.<s>
Anyway, I'm just imagining that merman have perpetual boners.<s>
But anyway, just a little bit of this, maybe an ounce or so.<s>
Just add a nice saltiness.<s>
So, we're not adding any other salt to this because between the chorizo and the cotija, we've got it made.<s>
But if you were leaving either one of those out, you probably want to add a little bit of salt.<s>
Mix that around.<s>
And this is not a melting cheese.<s>
It stays in chunks, and they just kind of get soft.<s>
So, it adds a nice little textural bite in there, a little chewy cheese curd kind of feel.<s>
You could use other types of cheese too.<s>
Just going to pull them out by the tips.<s>
Pull it out by the tip and let all the seeds drop out.<s>
You could leave them in if you wanted a really spicy sauce, but I don't know.<s>
To me, this doesn't really need to be like super hot.<s>
These peppers have a really nice fruity flavor.<s>
And the little garlic cloves that I dropped in.<s>
So, they'll still have a little bit of a rawness to them, but they're not going to be so sharp and spicy.<s>
So, I'm going to add, to start with, about a half cup of this soaking liquid.<s>
That's why I rinsed these peppers off first, because you want to be able to use this liquid, but not if it's full of weird gross shit, just jizz it around.<s>
Important safety note.<s>
When you're blending hot things in a blender, pressure builds up, and the lid can blow off.<s>
So, make sure that you allow it to like vent, just by sort of leaving a little thing like that.<s>
Or if you don't have like a little cap, you can just cover the blender with like a towel or something, doubled up, so you don't splatter your hand with hot liquid.<s>
Okay.<s>
Safety lesson over.<s>
Whoa, guys.<s>
That was loud.<s>
Okay.<s>
I'm going to check the consistency.<s>
Alright, that looks pretty good.<s>
Smells delicioso.<s>
I'm going to add a little bit of salt, maybe a quarter teaspoon or so.<s>
That's it.<s>
Our sauce is done.<s>
So, we can get rid of this.<s>
Magically, it goes over there.<s>
And then, for the enchilada part, I've got some corn tortillas.<s>
Typically, or traditionally, they're sort of like warmed up and softened in some warm oil before you roll the enchiladas.<s>
I have a cheer white girl method, and I'm just going to actually spray them with a little bit of spray oil.<s>
Boop.<s>
Boop.<s>
Boop.<s>
Boop.<s>
Boop.<s>
Boop.<s>
Then, stick them in the microwave for about 30 seconds, and you will see how beautifully pliable they become.<s>
Okay.<s>
See?<s>
These are nice and hot and soft.<s>
Your mileage may vary.<s>
You might need to put them in for a little bit longer, 60 seconds or so.<s>
But, looks good to me.<s>
So, we're going to put a little bit of our sauce down here.<s>
And then, you just want to dredge each tortilla in a little bit of this sauce.<s>
It's going to be a little bit messy.<s>
Don't wear your best shirt.<s>
Couple tablespoons of your filling.<s>
And then, shove it on back.<s>
A lot of times when I'm just making these for Chris and I, I'll just do like a half batch, and I won't even bother heating up in the oven.<s>
I'll just do it on a plate and like, microwave them or something.<s>
So, this last one, you've got to do a little maneuvering, a little Houdini-ing to get it covered, but you can do it.<s>
I promise you'll manage.<s>
Alright.<s>
Muy bien.<s>
Now, I'm just going to pour the rest of the sauce over the top.<s>
Well, maybe save a little bit back because it looks really pretty when you top it with egg.<s>
You can add a little bit more sauce on top of the egg too.<s>
Okay.<s>
Gorgeous.<s>
Alright.<s>
I'm going to put this in the oven, really just until I have some eggs fried or poached or however you want to do them.<s>
Bonus video recipe tip.<s>
How to fry an egg in a cast iron skillet.<s>
You have to use butter.<s>
Do not screw around with oil and frying eggs in a cast iron skillet.<s>
I have no idea why it doesn't work, but it doesn't work.<s>
You have to use butter.<s>
I'm sure I'm going to get a million comments telling me I'm totally wrong, but in my kitchen, I have to use butter, or the eggs just stick, and they make a huge mess.<s>
I'm heating this up over pretty high heat.<s>
I'm going to let this butter kind of -- It'll get a little foamy, and then the foam will subside.<s>
Don't let me down, butter.<s>
Do what I said that you'll do.<s>
Okay.<s>
I think that's hot enough.<s>
It's sort of popping and stuff.<s>
It's maybe almost about to turn brown.<s>
That's good.<s>
So, if you put it in, and it starts popping like that, that's good.<s>
It means you're probably not going to have your eggs stick to the pan.<s>
It also means you're probably going to get some little crusty brown bits, which I personally like.<s>
But if you don't, then you might want to try poaching your eggs or not using a cast iron skillet.<s>
Just kind of shimmy it.<s>
The handle will get hot, eventually, if you're frying a bunch of eggs.<s>
So, don't have to be like me and be all stupid.<s>
Turn the heat down if it's popping too much.<s>
So, it looks good.<s>
The bottom's all set, white.<s>
Get it moving like this, and then boop, like that.<s>
Turn the heat off immediately, because that residual heat is going to keep cooking it.<s>
So, it's not like totally done while I get my enchiladas out of the oven.<s>
Alright.<s>
Enchiladas are done.<s>
Oops.<s>
I scrunched it, but that's OK.<s>
It's going to taste awesome.<s>
Then, I'm going to cover it with a, hopefully, still runny egg.<s>
Come on.<s>
I'll just do that.<s>
Perfect.<s>
Okay.<s>
There you go.<s>
Breakfast enchiladas.<s>
I cannot wait to dig in.<s>
I have many other enchilada recipes on my website and videos.<s>
And also, check out my breakfast playlist, if you are so inclined.<s>
Let's just go ahead and see if the egg yolk is still runny.<s>
Hey.<s>
It's not runny, exactly, but it's moist.<s>
Why does that word gross everyone out so much?<s>
Okay.<s>
Get all this good stuff.<s>
I'm just going to take a big old honking bite.<s>
God damn it.<s>
If I can.<s>
Fork.<s>
My fork is traitor-ing me.<s>
That is what I'm talking about.<s>
This is what I want for breakfast if I ever come to stay at your house, like impromptu like bed and breakfast session.<s>
This is what I want you to make me.<s>
Okay?<s>

<transcript id="2" title="Confetti Birthday Cake Recipe - Laura Vitale - Laura in the Kitchen Episode 796 " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAPmbQg4pbU" mode="non-automatic">
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the Kitchen, I'm going to bring you what I like to call my Confetti Birthday Cake.<s>
Now, my birthday is in November, I have never had a birthday party in the Summer.<s>
So, what did I do last weekend?<s>
Celebrated my own birthday.<s>
With a birthday cake!<s>
And I figured I'd share this recipe with you because so many of you write me and send me e-mails saying 'Can you show me a birthday cake?'.<s>
Now, you know I don't make any sort of fancy cakes with fondant and all these cool characters, that's just not my style - I like really good food!<s>
And I love anything homemade.<s>
So this is a gorgeous fluffy, light vanilla cake with a gorgeous buttercream, so it is absolutely amazing, let me take you over the ingredients so we can get started!<s>
You'll need all purpose flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, egg whites, unsalted butter, softened at room temperature, a little bit of sour cream, some whole milk, vanilla extract and I've got some jimmies!<s>
Now, this is what's going to go all the way through my batter, and it's going to be so good!<s>
Now, comment below and let me know what your childhood birthday cake was, now to be completely honest with you, when I was a child, I didn't want a birthday cake, I wanted pastiera.<s>
That was the birthday cake of choice!<s>
But I would love to know from you - And I would love to know when your - your birthday month and what the cake that you would like to have.<s>
And maybe you might see it pop up on Laura in the Kitchen!<s>
So, I thought that might be fun!<s>
I'm just taking my egg whites and I'm going to use my standing mixer to whip these up.<s>
I'm going to whip these until they've got stiff peaks and I'll show you what it looks like when they're there.<s>
It should take a couple minutes.<s>
Beautiful!<s>
Now, I don't need the egg whites at this very moment, I actually need them later on in the recipe, but like I did previously on a different episode, if I need to whip the egg whites and do it in the standing mixer, I might as well get them done and out of the way because you can't whip egg whites in a dirty bowl, so you want to get those done and out of the way.<s>
So now that that's done - and don't worry if a little bit remains, that's totally fine!<s>
I'm going to put this back on, I'm going to switch to a paddle attachment and I'm going to add - get my beautiful egg whites, look at that - out of the way.<s>
I'm going to add my softened butter, really important that it's nice and soft.<s>
And my sugar.<s>
I'm going to get these nice and creamy and fluffy.<s>
My excitement is making me stutter, but this is going to be gorgeous, and now you've noticed we haven't added whole eggs, and that's because we want this to be a gorgeous white fluffy cake, it's absolutely delicious - really a treat, I have to say, but so worth it!<s>
Especially if it's your birthday.<s>
It's my birthday and I will eat cake all I want!<s>
Ha!<s>
It's my pretend birthday anyway!<s>
I'm just going to whisk this up, or mix it until it's nice and fluffy.<s>
That's looking good, I'm going to add a splash of vanilla extract and at this point, I'm also going to add my sour cream.<s>
I'm not adding very much but this little tiny bit is going to go a long way and give you the fluffiest thing ever - the fluffiest cake ever, but if you don't have it, you can use yogurt, if you don't have yogurt, just use a little extra milk - it'll be totally fine.<s>
So, raise this up, get these combined, and in the meantime I am just going to take a quick second to mix together my flour, baking powder and salt.<s>
You don't have to do it perfectly.<s>
Just want them to be pretty much mixed together.<s>
Now, I"m going to add half of my flour - about half.<s>
And half of my milk.<s>
Bring this back up, mix it together and then you add the rest of your flour, the rest of your milk and your batter is almost done!<s>
That's looking gorgeous, I'm going to add my jimmies in now, and the jimmies are really the best kind of sprinkle confetti to use for this, but by all means, you can use anything that you prefer, this is just what I prefer.<s>
I'm going to just take that off now.<s>
I want to be able to fold in the egg whites by hand, that way I can make sure that they're not being over mixed and they deflate.<s>
But, totally forgot to tell you that the first thing you want to do, of course, is get your oven preheated to 350F, get a couple of 9 inch baking pans, or cake pans, whatever you call them, line them with parchment paper and spray them well with some non-stick spray.<s>
Those are ready and waiting.<s>
And now what I'm doing, I'm just taking my spatula, and I like to mix everything from the bottom, up.<s>
Look how gorgeous that is.<s>
And now, I'm going to take my egg whites - I'll do half at a time - and mix that in there, this is going to be just beautiful and it's going to help the cake rise and it's just stunning!<s>
Just going to mix that up.<s>
Once it's all mixed, you want to divide the batter evenly, or as even as you can manage among your baking pans, or your cake pans.<s>
Okay, now these are going to go into my preheated oven at 350F for about 30-35 minutes or until they're fully cooked, and then we'll get going on making the buttercream which if you love wedding cake frosting, that's what a buttercream is, it is just.. ah!<s>
The stuff of dreams.<s>
Okay, let's pop this in.<s>
My cakes baked for about 30 minutes and I've let them cool completely on a wire rack, and now what I've done with one of them - they're not too domed, because remember, we didn't add the egg yolks, we just sort of whipped the egg whites and it falls a bit, kind of like a pavlova almost.<s>
What I did, I put it on a cake stand and then I just put a few pieces of parchment paper around so that the cake stand itself doesn't get dirty once i go ahead and frost it.<s>
We're going to make a really simple buttercream and it really couldn't be easier.<s>
The first thing you're going to do is you need to start with butter that's been softened at room temperature - that is so, so crucial!<s>
You absolutely need it to be at the proper stage.<s>
So what I have here is a good amount of butter, because again, this is buttercream and I'm making this in my standing mixer just because it's easier and needs to whisk for a long time, so just going to pop that in.<s>
Just going to add some vanilla extract - about a tablespoon of it - because it is a vanilla buttercream after all.<s>
And I'm just going to whisk this up until just the butter starts, you know, gets going, and then i have some confectioner's sugar here and some whole milk.<s>
Just going to wait for this to kind of get a head start and then we'll add in the sugar.<s>
Okay, now what I also have here that I failed to mention is just a small pinch of salt, and because this is all confectioner's sugar - which I know is a lot - but it is a buttercream, you just need to add a little salt to cut all the sweetness.<s>
It really does - it's a great balance.<s>
I'm just going to add my sugar, trying to not get all over the place, and I think I did pretty well.<s>
Let's see.<s>
Yeah.<s>
Pretty well.<s>
And just a splash of milk, only a couple tablespoons of milk.<s>
And now I'm going to get this up and get it going and mixing, and this could take up to ten minutes, I mean buttercream goes from messy, to crumbly, to perfection, so you just need to have patience and the great thing is you're not doing it by hand, you're using a standing mixer, so it makes life a lot easier.<s>
Just going to let that continue to go, go, go until it's the perfect consistency and I'll show you what it looks like when it's there.<s>
That is perfection!<s>
It took a good four minutes of mixing, but, I mean look at that!It's so fluffy.<s>
Look at that!<s>
So worth the wait.<s>
So worth it.<s>
And yes, again, it's really rich but I promise you this is a once in a while treat - it's like a wedding cake, you don't eat it very often and most of the time, frostings that are used on wedding cakes are buttercream.<s>
So I'm just going to mix - I get like immense pleasure when it comes to buttercream because if you make buttercream at home, then you know the consistency that you are looking for, so there's just something about it that just gives me great pleasure, so this is completely done, and now we'll get going on frosting.<s>
I'm just going to take a little bit of it, not too much, about I'd say a third.<s>
And I'm just using an offset spatula here, a flat spatula to just smear this, you don't have to go all the way to the edge, although it doesn't matter because we are going to cover the whole thing.<s>
Mmm, I can't wait to have a slice of this, you have no idea!<s>
If your birthday is in the Summer, jealous.<s>
Very jealous.<s>
Take the remaining frosting.<s>
Trying to get it all out of here.<s>
Now I have - my birthday is in November, and I remember one year my mother threw a birthday party for me in the Summer because I remember crying because all my friends when I was a child - their birthdays were in warmer months, so they could have parties outside, and I never could, so I remember my mother once threw me a party in like the middle of July which was amazing.<s>
So, I envy those who have Summer birthdays because they get to be outside and have parties.<s>
But, I'm just going to frost this, as you can see I'm draping down and then this is where I love my rotating cake stand, and this is why, by the way, you put parchment down because if that were to happen, especially if you are anything like me, you are a complete and total mess when you frost cakes - it helps a lot.<s>
And then I just like to take the top and just do little swirls like that.<s>
You don't have to do this, clearly I'm not a master at decorating cakes, it is just my way of making it look fancy.<s>
It's terrible, I know.<s>
Decorating cakes is not my forte - okay?<s>
Or my mother's.<s>
This is why the parchment is so beautiful, because now, you get to take the parchment off and you have no mess on your hands.<s>
Don't ya love when that happens?<s>
No mess, and then you look like a pro and then you don't tell your friends that this is the trick, that way they're like 'How did you manage to do that' and you're like 'I'm that good!<s>
I know!'.<s>
And then I'm going to take additional jimmies, because I want everyone to see that this is a confetti birthday cake.<s>
And I'm going to put them all over the top.<s>
The more the merrier when it comes to jimmies!<s>
Now, somehow, there's a plate and a fork in front of me.<s>
Which leads me to believe that even though it's only my pretend birthday, I should still have a piece of cake.<s>
So I'm going to do it!<s>
I'm going to go in for it!<s>
Going to go in for that right there.<s>
Oh, that's going to be a big piece Laura!<s>
But it is your pretend birthday, so you really should indulge.<s>
Waaaaa!<s>
Now, if you don't like as much frosting, half the recipe - make half the amount of frosting, it'll be a really thin layer but hey, it's your pretend birthday, you do what you want!<s>
Look at that!<s>
Look at the jimmies all the way through.<s>
Look!<s>
If you had a confetti cake for your birthday, thumbs up this video.<s>
And I love you, and I'm jealous of you.<s>
I really do like my pastiera.<s>
That's where it's at!<s>
Mmm hmm..<s>
It's such a beautifully flavored cake, that buttercream is like that wedding frosting that we all know and love and we get to eat like maybe once a year.<s>
Absolutely divine.<s>
Go to LauraintheKitchen.com to get this recipe, I hope you have enjoyed spending time with me, let me know what your favorite birthday cake is because I would love to recreate it for your special day.<s>
Thank you for watching and I'll see you soon!<s>
Bye bye!<s>

<transcript id="3" title="Cookie Dough Ice Cream Recipe - Laura Vitale - Laura in the Kitchen Episode 781 " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dmW7QynDTY" mode="non-automatic">
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and today, upon your requests, we are making Cookie Dough Ice Cream!<s>
I've had so many people ask for this recipe, it's insane!<s>
And, it's actually really really simple.<s>
I've also had some people ask me if cookie dough ice cream is just simply crushed up chocolate chip cookies in ice cream.<s>
It's not, so today we are going to make the real thing.<s>
It's so, so easy, and ice cream is something that I really only make in the Summertime, so I'm always looking forward to sharing a new recipe with you.<s>
The recipe to make the custard is pretty simple and basic.<s>
You're going to need some whole milk, heavy cream, egg yolks, sugar, I also have a pinch of salt and either vanilla bean, or I've got some vanilla bean paste here so it makes my life a little bit easier.<s>
This is really easy.<s>
Now, we are going to make the custard now, and then I'll show you later how to make the cookie dough and then when we combine everything together it is going to be money!<s>
Okay, let's get started - so simple!<s>
I've got a large sauce pan here, and in here I'm going to add my cream and milk, add them both at the same time - makes me feel fancy like that.<s>
And then we're going to add in a good spoonful of the vanilla paste.<s>
You would need one vanilla bean that you would scrape down and get rid of - you know, take all the seeds out and put it in here - the vanilla beans.<s>
But, I'm using vanilla paste so, a nice healthy spoonful of that should do the trick.<s>
So, I'm just going to take this off.<s>
I'm going to put this on my stove top, and let this come to temperature to a simmer over about medium-low heat.<s>
Now, while my milk mixture is coming to a simmer, I'm going to just take my egg yolks and sugar with a little pinch of salt, and I"m going to whisk these together until the mixture becomes really nice, thick and pale in color.<s>
I'll show you what it looks like when it gets there.<s>
Basically - essentially what we are making right now is kind of like a zabaglione, zabaglione is nothing but - which I'll show you in a different recipe - is just egg yolks, sugar, a little bit of booze, and you are good to go!<s>
But this needs to be whisked until it's really light and pale, and about doubled in volume.<s>
I'll show you what it looks like when it's there.<s>
Keep an eye out on your milk mixture, you do not want it to come to a boil, because if it does, it will split and then you're going to have to start all over and waste all that milk and cream and vanilla.<s>
So, keep an eye on that it should take just a coupe of minutes and you should be done with the egg yolk mixture as well - and you're getting an awesome arm workout while you're at it!<s>
My milk is at the right temperature, you can see there are little bubbles starting to form around the edge of the pot, which is when I know that it's at a perfect simmer.<s>
My egg yolk, as you can see, i'll show you the texture - the consistency - see it kind of falls down on a ribbon, oh that's perfect!<s>
I'm going to temper the egg yolks by just taking a little bit of my milk mixture, just about a half cup or so, and this is all it's doing is tempering the egg yolks so that they don't get shocked when you pour them into the pan with the hot liquid.<s>
That's all you need to do.<s>
I'm going to now pour my egg yolk mixture into my pan, very simple, just making an easy, easy and very classic ice cream custard base.<s>
Now I'm going to - look at the color of that!<s>
Look at that color!It just makes me so happy, you have no idea!<s>
Okay, I am going to just switch back to my wooden spoon, and I'm going to cook this over about low heat until it thickens really nicely and it coats the back of my spoon, and I will show you what it looks like when it's there.<s>
Just make sure you keep this at a low heat and take your time and be gentle, because if this comes to a boil, or it gets too hot, it will split.<s>
And once it splits, again, you will know when it splits, and there is no going back, so just take your time.<s>
Stir it in a figure eight motion, kind of like I am doing right now.<s>
And then just be patient and when it gets nice and thick, you will be able to notice it immediately.<s>
My custard is ready, it has been cooking for about six minutes and you can see it is coating the back of a spoon and if I run my finger down and the custard stays separated, you know it's thick enough!<s>
Doesn't really get any easier than that!<s>
I'm going to pass this through a sieve just in case there are any egg shells remaining or anything curdled, or whatever.<s>
It stays back, and doesn't get into your final mixture.<s>
As you can see, this is smooth sailing all the way.<s>
That's how I like it!<s>
That's how I like it!<s>
Nice and smooth, there's really nothing - maybe a little, little tiny bit of something remaining, but for the most part everything is really nice and smooth.<s>
Okay, now, you need to wrap this with plastic wrap, and you want to make sure that the plastic is actually touching the surface of the custard, because otherwise it just forms a really weird looking skin that you don't want and it's definitely not going to be smooth and delightful once you go ahead and freeze this.<s>
So I'm going to pop this into the fridge - it needs to be in the fridge for about four to six hours or best, overnight.<s>
That's even better.<s>
If you can put this in the fridge overnight, it's even better.<s>
I'm going to leave this in, it's pretty early in the day so I'll get to finish this this afternoon and I'll show you what it looks like once this is chilled.<s>
We'll get going on making our cookie dough and we'll pull the whole thing off together!<s>
While the custard is chilling, we're going to get going on making the cookie dough batter.<s>
Now we're actually making a chocolate chip cookie dough batter here, and now, if that - chocolate chip cookie dough - if that bothers you because none of this is going to be cooked, so you're kind of eating raw cookie dough, which I love and I know everyone eats raw cookie dough at some point in their lives - now if this bothers you, then you might want to skip this ice cream in its entirety.<s>
You can make my chocolate ice cream, you can make my strawberry, mint chocolate chip, vanilla whatever you want - I've got a ton of recipes on my website.<s>
But, most of the time, cookie dough ice cream has actual cookie dough in it, and that's what makes it so delicious.<s>
So, we're going to make it like we would make chocolate chip cookies, but really easy - and to do that, you'll need some all purpose flour, I've got a pinch of salt and I've got some instant espresso powder here, just a small little pinch, brown sugar, granulated sugar, some softened unsalted butter, an egg, vanilla extract, and what I have here are some chocolate chips that I've pulsed in my food processor so you can see that I've got little rubbles, I've got some that are bigger.<s>
I've got some that are kind of whole, and I think the thing that I love about cookie dough ice cream is that you actually get bits and pieces of chocolate chips or chocolate throughout the entire ice cream.<s>
And I think that just by pulsing it a few times, and breaking the pieces up a bit just gives it a little more interest, and I think these itty bitty, almost dust-like pieces of the chocolate is what makes this so divine, in my opinion.<s>
So if you want to skip doing that part, by all means, do that, but I think that it's kind of crucial.<s>
I also have a nine by thirteen inch baking pan here, and I have a big piece of parchment paper because you want to make sure you can lift it up.<s>
That's sitting aside, so let's get going, I'm going to just cream together my butter, and both kinds of sugar.<s>
I'm going to do this in just a little bowl because I don't feel like getting my mixer out for just a small batch, so I'm just going to mix these two together until combined.<s>
That's looking good enough, I'm going to add in my egg.<s>
Again, you want to make sure that whoever you're making this for will eat raw cookie dough.<s>
Just want to make sure you don't have anyone that can't eat raw egg or whatnot, just give them a heads up.<s>
I'm going to switch to my whisk briefly, just to mix everything together a little bit better.<s>
Just mixing together the coffee and salt.<s>
Now I'm not adding any leavening agents to this - no baking soda - you don't need to, I mean you're not baking it so it's not going to make a difference.<s>
I'm going to put my egg mixture in here, normally I would put the dry into my wet, but I switched bowls for some reason and the flour was in the bigger bowl and I just wanted to have plenty of room to mix this together.<s>
And that's basically all I'm doing, I'm just going to combine this until it forms into a dough, and then I can add in - I can actually add in my chocolate now because it's almost there so I might as well because I don't want to overwork this anyway.<s>
Add in my chocolate chip mixture, you can also add - take a bar of chocolate and chop that up if you wanted to, that would be lovely, instead of adding chocolate chips, or you can add mini chocolate chips.<s>
But, you see what I mean when I say that I think that this is so much better because that way you're really getting chocolate throughout every little teeny tiny bite of the cookie dough.<s>
Otherwise, you just get chocolate chips here, chocolate chips there, but I want chocolate completely infused throughout the entire cookie dough, so that's why I like to pulse it, and it's those kinds of little things that really make a difference, otherwise you know I would skip it.<s>
Okay, now I'm going to put this closer to me, get my cookie dough out of here.<s>
Oops!<s>
We'll fix that in a minute, do not panic!<s>
Talking to myself, by the way.<s>
Now, all I'm doing - and this can be a little bit tricky, I'm trying to get this into a pretty thin layer because when we freeze this and I pull this out of the freezer, we're going to need to chop it into small pieces.<s>
But clearly, you can see that I'm not too worried about getting it perfect, and I don't want you to be that worried about it either.<s>
And it doesn't have to be all on one layer, I'm just doing it this way because it's easier to cut it once it's frozen.<s>
So, just going to do that, and then I'm going to pop this into my freezer, probably for several hours or however long it takes for the custard to chill.<s>
The more frozen, the better.<s>
The easier it's going to be for us to chop it up.<s>
So I'm going to pop this in, looks odd now, but trust me when I tell you, it works wonders.<s>
Popping this in, waiting for my custard to get nice and cool, and then we'll go on and put it all in the little machine and get that much closer to eating cookie dough ice cream!<s>
My custard was in the fridge overnight, I was going to leave it in there for a few hours, but then we had my aunt over, and maybe a cocktail or two, and we decided to wait until tomorrow to have ice cream - which is good because it's the weekend - perfect time for entertaining and having ice cream!<s>
Now, I have my ice cream machine here, you want to make sure that the insert of your ice cream machine, which is this right here, that's going to basically freeze your ice cream for you, is frozen.<s>
Now, you want to always check your manufacturer's instructions because every ice cream machine is different from others, so mine says to put it in there overnight, so that's what I do, and it's really nice and frozen solid which is really important, so make sure that you read your instructions because some might just need a couple of hours, but most of the time they'll take overnight.<s>
Now I have my really cold custard, which is absolutely fantastic, I mean look at that!<s>
This would be good on it's own, as-is over top of maybe berries or whatnot.<s>
I'm going to pour that in there.<s>
Get it all out.<s>
Okay, and now I'm just going to turn this on, now again, check your manufacturer's instructions because the time is going to vary.<s>
Mine takes a good twenty-five to thirty minutes to freeze the ice cream, but they're all so different.<s>
So, I'm going to wait for this to be pretty much - pretty much fully frozen, and then we'll get going on adding our cookie dough!<s>
Alright, my ice cream is exactly where I want it.<s>
It's been about twenty five minutes, now I'm going to take my cookie dough that was in the freezer overnight as well, which is what we want.<s>
And this is why I do it on parchment because it's so easy!<s>
And now, I just take a sharp knife, and in no particular way, I just - I'm just going to chop this up into bite sized pieces, that is it.<s>
You can - you really can do this a couple of different ways.<s>
Instead of doing it the way I am doing it, you can take little teaspoons of the batter - you know, once you make it and then put it on a baking sheet lined with parchment and freeze it that way and then you can just put them right into your ice cream machine.<s>
I tend to do it this way, I don't know why, I just think it's easier, and gets the job done a lot faster, and you can also leave certain pieces bigger or smaller, like that's perfect.<s>
Now I'm just going to go across, and just rough chop-age on everything until you've got about bite sized pieces.<s>
That's it!<s>
And I did want to mention that it sounds like this is really hard, but it's not, it just sounds hard because we're cutting through chocolate.<s>
I just wanted to mention that because as I was doing this, I'm thinking - you know you can hear the crunch, but the crunch is just because we are chopping up the chocolate, so anyway, figured I would let you guys know that.<s>
And now I'm just going to take these - and you can cut these as big or as small as you want.<s>
And you can add as much or as little as you want to your cookie dough batter, it's up to you.<s>
I'm going to add most of it, but most likely not all of it because it's a lot, and then we can also add some for people to serve, you know, sprinkle on top.<s>
Then just let them mix in as this is running.<s>
Yeah buddy!<s>
Now I only added about half of the chocolate cookie dough mixture in here because I didn't want to add too, too much because then you can also have a hard time with your machine being able to handle all that.<s>
But look at this!<s>
I mean, are you seeing what I'm seeing?!<s>
And also, are you seeing how those little rubbles of chocolate kind of spread all throughout the batter?And that's from when I took the chocolate chips and put them through the food processor, because that's what I personally like.<s>
Obviously, you want big chocolate chips here and there, but why have a little bit when you can have chocolate throughout?<s>
Ah, look at that, if you get up close you can see that it's really creamy, it has those big chunks of cookie dough.<s>
I'm just going to make myself a little ice cream.<s>
Okay?<s>
Just a scoop.<s>
Just a scoop, on a cone because I'm deserving.<s>
Look!<s>
Whoooaa!<s>
Look at that!<s>
Look at all the pieces!<s>
Mmm.<s>
You'll love this!<s>
I promise you will love this.<s>
It's so easy, tastes so much better than store bought, I cannot stress it enough.<s>
It's insanely easy to do, doesn't take a lot of time, it doesn't take any fancy ingredients.<s>
It's very basic but it's done the right way, and you can see - I mean, it's just - it's phenomenal.<s>
Look at the chocolate pieces in there!<s>
[humming] I was trying to sing in my head, but... LauraintheKitchen.com will have the recipe written for you, let me know what ice cream you want to see next.<s>
Hope you've enjoyed spending time with me and I'll see you next time!<s>
Bye bye!<s>

<transcript id="4" title="Cracker Barrel Fried Apples -  CopyKat.com " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8xo3vjLnB0" mode="non-automatic">
Hi, this is Stephanie Manley with CopyKat.com.<s>
Don't you just love Cracker Barrel's fried apples?<s>
Well, guess what?<s>
I'm going to show you how to make Cracker Barrel's famous fried apples, at home and in your own kitchen.<s>
All right, so I'm just finishing chopping up my apples.<s>
You can make this recipe with about five or six apples.<s>
My recipe calls for either butter or bacon drippings.<s>
Now the Cracker Barrel doesn't use bacon drippings in theirs, but you know what?<s>
This tastes really good with bacon drippings, and that's how my grandma used to do it, so I can testify that that makes them very, very tasty.<s>
This recipe just has a few ingredients in it.<s>
That's about five or six tart apples, some brown sugar, a little bit of nutmeg, some cinnamon and lemon juice.<s>
So after you finish slicing up all of your apples, you want to keep them a nice pretty color, so we are going to add just a little bit of lemon juice to this, and give it a stir before we take this over to the stove and start cooking our fried apples.<s>
Okay, so we're going to get started on our apples.<s>
We're going to take our butter and melt that in the bottom of our skillet.<s>
Again, you can go ahead and use bacon drippings if you happen to have bacon drippings.<s>
It'll taste just as good.<s>
I'm going to let that butter get nice and melted, and next I'm going to add my apples.<s>
I'm just going to pour them evenly on the bottom of my skillet.<s>
I'm cooking these on a medium heat, not too high, and not too low.<s>
I am using an all-clad skillet here, but you know what?<s>
I've seen many chefs use far less expensive skillets, so I think any skillet will really do.<s>
In fact, an iron skillet will be great for this as well.<s>
All right, so my butter is all nice and melted right now, and the apples are just beginning to release some of their juices.<s>
So now we are going to sprinkle in our brown sugar, so we've added in our brown sugar, it's just beginning to melt.<s>
I am going to add in my cinnamon, and I am going to add in a little bit of nutmeg, and I'm just going to stir to incorporate.<s>
These smell just incredible.<s>
Now this butter and brown sugar is going to make a really, nice, thick syrup, so these apples will fry in syrup, and the butter.<s>
It's going to take about 15-20 minutes for these to finish up.<s>
Then we'll come back, when they're all nice and done.<s>
All right, so we're about halfway cooking these apples, and you can see we have this wonderful thick syrup right here.<s>
So while these are cooking, just be sure to stir them every couple minutes.<s>
You're going to have some fabulous fried apples, so now you know how to make Cracker Barrel fried apples, but you know what?<s>
I've got lots more great recipes online at copykat.com, and if you're watching this video on YouTube be sure to like or give the video a thumbs up, and let me know what recipe you would like to see next.<s>
These are my apples, and you can see this wonderfully, creamy, syrupy sauce is all over these apples.<s>
They're nice and soft now and they're going to taste just great!<s>
We're going to give this one a try, so good.<s>

<transcript id="5" title="Cracker Barrel Grilled Chicken Tenders " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxiWv67tl4" mode="non-automatic">
Thank you for joining me here on Copycat Recipes.<s>
Today I'm going to show you how to make Cracker Barrel chicken tenders.<s>
They are really easy to make and they're going to taste just like they do in the restaurant, and they have just four simple ingredients in them.<s>
Let me tell you what's in them.<s>
We're going to have chicken tenders in here.<s>
Now if you don't have chicken tenders, you can use a boneless skinless breast.<s>
Just cut it up into strips that are about one-inch wide and those will be perfect.<s>
We're going to use Italian dressing, any brand will do.<s>
Honestly, don't spend a lot on this.<s>
Just buy what's ever on sale.<s>
It's going to be great.<s>
We're also going to use a little bit of honey and a couple of limes for a little bit of citrus zest.<s>
We're going to mix up the marinade.<s>
We're going to marinade these chicken tenders for about an hour.<s>
Then we're going to cook them and they'll be perfect and they'll taste just like they do in the restaurant.<s>
So we're going to begin by making the marinade and this is really, really easy to do.<s>
You are going to take one lime and slice it, and we're just going to go ahead and squeeze the lime into our container.<s>
Now, I am mixing my marinade in the same container that I'm going to marinade the chicken in.<s>
That way I can save a dish.<s>
Be on the lookout for any seeds, just in case that they come in.<s>
You're going to need about a tablespoon of honey.<s>
Then you're going to need about half a bottle of the Italian dressing.<s>
This is a 16 ounce bottle.<s>
So we're going to use about half of this for the marinade.<s>
Italian dressing, you can marinade anything in it.<s>
Vegetables, steaks, all kinds of stuff.<s>
All right.<s>
So I'm going to give this a quick little stir.<s>
Then I'm going to simply put my chicken in here.<s>
Now I have about a pound of chicken in here.<s>
If you have a little bit more, that'll be fine.<s>
We're going to marinade the chicken now.<s>
Now marinade only works for the first time.<s>
So after we finish cooking the chicken you need to discard the marinade and don't use it again.<s>
So we're going to give this a quick little shake.<s>
Put this in the fridge and we're going to come back in an hour and we're going to show you how to cook these up.<s>
All right.<s>
So our chicken has been marinating for just about an hour and it's time to go ahead and cook it.<s>
Now, I'm just using a regular skillet, just a nice large flat bottom skillet.<s>
I'm going to stick a little bit of oil in the bottom of the pan.<s>
You can use olive oil, vegetable oil, it really doesn't matter.<s>
You want to let this get a little bit warm.<s>
And remember for when it comes to this chicken marinade, don't use it again.<s>
It's for one time only.<s>
You can see it smells really good right now.<s>
And we will begin cooking it in just  a second.<s>
Okay, so we're going to begin cooking the chicken.<s>
Our pan is hot now.<s>
So you're just going to shake off the marinade here and just drop it in the pan.<s>
You're going to need to cook these on a medium, medium high heat for a couple of minutes on each side.<s>
It's not going to take any time at all.<s>
All right, now that I've put all the chicken in the pan, you don't want to crowd it, you want to give it a little bit of space so it cooks nice and evenly.<s>
Be sure to discard the fork that you use for the marinade and get another one.<s>
We don't want raw chicken to contaminate anything else, so it's a clean fork right here.<s>
These are again, going to take about two to three minutes on each side and we're going to have perfectly cooked Cracker Barrel chicken tenders.<s>
So you're going to know the chicken is starting to cook, if you look on the side of the chicken you'll see that it's starting to turn white.<s>
This will help you know that the chicken is actually cooking.<s>
No one likes raw chicken.<s>
So go ahead and make sure your chicken is cooked thoroughly.<s>
So my chickens not yet ready to turn over just yet.<s>
So I'm going to put it back down and wait another minute or so and it should be nice and brown.<s>
You can see this chicken is just starting to brown nicely, so I'm going to go ahead and flip it.<s>
Okay, you can see this chicken is wonderfully browned now.<s>
We're going to go ahead and take it out of the pan here.<s>
This stuff is great on salads.<s>
You might just want to make some up.<s>
Serve it on a plate with a couple of vegetables and you have dinner that didn't take too long at all.<s>
You could marinade this before you leave for work or even the night before for a little extra flavor.<s>
And here you go.<s>
There are some wonderful Cracker Barrel chicken tenders.<s>
So we've just made the Cracker Barrel grilled chicken tenders.<s>
That was really easy.<s>
It just took four ingredients.<s>

<transcript id="6" title="Egg Rolls Recipe |  Hilah Cooking " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cud-ZTvCxx0" mode="non-automatic">
Hey, dudes.<s>
I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking, I'm making Chinese egg rolls, which might more appropriately be called Chinese-American egg rolls because they're a complete bastardization of original Chinese spring rolls, I'm sure.<s>
But anyway, these are great for snacks, appetizers, or even Easter because they're called egg rolls.<s>
Get it?<s>
That'll really throw your guests for a loop.<s>
They'll be like, 'What the f-- is Chinese food doing here with the ham?<s>
' Okay.<s>
The first thing we're going to do is make our filling.<s>
So, these have a precooked filling that you will cook it, and then cool it before we fill the egg rolls.<s>
I'm going to add a little bit of oil to my pan and start sauteing.<s>
I've got some super, very, very finely minced celery and onion here.<s>
So, while that's going, I've got also here about a half a pound of ground pork.<s>
You can use ground turkey, or you can leave out the meat completely and add some more vegetables if you want to also.<s>
I'm going to add to this -- This bowl, I've got some brown sugar, some corn starch, and some minced garlic and ginger.<s>
So, when you add corn starch to ground meat like this, it kind of helps lock in the moisture.<s>
So the meat doesn't dry out, and it helps it sort of bind together.<s>
So, it's serving two purposes.<s>
I'm just going to mix this in with the ground meat here.<s>
Also going to add about a tablespoon of soy sauce to this and some pepper.<s>
I'm going to use white pepper, but you can use black pepper or red pepper if you want it a little bit spicier, and a little bit of salt also.<s>
I'm going to add a little bit of salt to these vegetables too, to draw some of that moisture out, to sweat them a little bit.<s>
They'll soften up a little quicker.<s>
And then, just get our meat mixed up and add that to the skillet also.<s>
Then, we just want to stir it around, break the meat up as much as you can, and eventually, it'll sort of come into really, really tiny little crumbles.<s>
So, keep an eye on that and have a brew while you're waiting, because nothing goes with egg rolls like beer.<s>
Right?<s>
You could also have water, but hey.<s>
Look.<s>
Tecate Light.<s>
I'm saving calories on my beer so that I can have more fried egg rolls later.<s>
Beautiful.<s>
Okay.<s>
Just a few minutes later, it looks like this.<s>
I'm going to turn the heat off.<s>
You just want to make sure that any big chunks of meat are sort of broken up.<s>
You want, really, a very fine filling for these egg rolls.<s>
Then, transfer it to a plate.<s>
You can use a baking sheet or something.<s>
We just want to spread it out so that it cools off faster.<s>
If there's any oil left in the bottom of your pan, you can try to keep that behind.<s>
We'll use that to cook the cabbage also.<s>
Okay.<s>
We'll set that aside.<s>
Then, back in the same skillet.<s>
I'm going to add a tiny bit more oil, and we'll add the cabbage.<s>
So, this is shredded Napa cabbage.<s>
I just sliced it really, really finely.<s>
You can use regular old green cabbage too.<s>
That'll give you more sort of texture inside your egg roll, and that's more common in restaurants.<s>
I don't know.<s>
I had Napa cabbage.<s>
So, I'm using Napa cabbage.<s>
Either one is fine.<s>
You can also add bean sprouts and things like that.<s>
So, we're just going to saute this until the cabbage is wilted.<s>
It shouldn't take very long at all.<s>
Okay.<s>
So, cabbage getting nice and wilted.<s>
We don't want to get it too soft because you want to keep a little bit of texture, and it'll still continue to cook, even after you've turned the heat off.<s>
So, this looks pretty good.<s>
The leafy parts are nice and soft, but the stemmy parts are still a little crispy.<s>
So, I'm going to turn that off, and I'm going to add some water chestnuts.<s>
These is just like -- These is just like-- A can of water chestnuts that I drained and minced finely.<s>
And then, I'm also going to add some mushrooms.<s>
These are dried Shiitake mushrooms that I've just had soaking in water for about an hour.<s>
Wood ear mushrooms are, like those black ones that are really firm, are also commonly used in egg rolls.<s>
These are a little bit easier to find, usually.<s>
So, squeeze the water out.<s>
Then, I'm just going to mince up these mushrooms too.<s>
And then, finally to this, I'm going to add a tablespoon of regular, all purpose flour and mix that in.<s>
That's just going to help the filling stay kind of firm.<s>
As it cools, it'll thicken it up.<s>
So, it'll sort of make a mass that you can form into little egg rolls.<s>
I'm going to spread this out on top of the meat mix.<s>
Then, we'll just put this whole thing in the fridge and let it get super chilled.<s>
You can make the filling a day ahead of time, even two days ahead of time, which is muy excelente when you've had a lot of brews.<s>
Okay.<s>
Time to roll these mofos.<s>
This is just about half the mixture.<s>
It's cooled off totally.<s>
These are my egg roll wrappers.<s>
You can find these in the frozen section, usually, of pretty much any major grocery store.<s>
You just want to thaw them out, and then keep the rest of them covered while you're rolling them so they don't dry out.<s>
It dries out pretty quickly.<s>
So, there's two here.<s>
God damn it.<s>
They stick together.<s>
Stick together like a hand in glove.<s>
These egg roll wrappers are the best of friends.<s>
Okay.<s>
It's going on my album, guys.<s>
Stay tuned.<s>
Stay iTuned.<s>
Just kidding.<s>
Okay.<s>
So, you want to get a big spoonful, maybe like a quarter cup or so of your mixture.<s>
Put it pretty much right in the center, maybe a little bit below the center, but pretty much just right on, bros. And then, roll the bottom up.<s>
What I like to do is kind of take it over, and then pull it back.<s>
Did you see how I did that?<s>
Did you see how I did that?<s>
So that it gets a nice little tight log.<s>
Fold this side over.<s>
Fold this side over.<s>
Then, in this little bowl, I've got just a mixture of plain flour and water, about equal parts, maybe a little bit more water.<s>
It's not important really.<s>
Just use your finger to go.<s>
I like to sort of get these sides here, like the envelope sides, and then the little point also.<s>
This is going to kind of glue it together.<s>
Then, just roll it over like that.<s>
Just like that.<s>
Make sure that you have enough in that little tippy tip.<s>
There we go.<s>
So then, we want to set this aside, seam side down on a plate.<s>
You can make these and let them sit for maybe, like, ten or 15 minutes tops.<s>
But eventually, and pretty quickly, the filling, the liquid in the filling and the oil in the filling is going to kind of soak through the wrapper.<s>
So, you can't really make them really ahead of time.<s>
But like I said, you can make the filling ahead of time.<s>
Then, just roll up a few.<s>
Then, as you're frying the first batch, you or someone else, ideally you have a little helper, a little kitchen elf, will be rolling the next batch.<s>
So, it's kind of a fun thing to do if you have friends that like to cook, to have them over, and let's all make egg rolls together.<s>
You can make some different fillings.<s>
You can put shrimp in them, or you could make vegetarian ones.<s>
You could put carrots in them.<s>
You could put whatever in them.<s>
Good.<s>
So, I'm going to roll up about six of these while I start heating up my oil.<s>
I've got some peanut oil in the skillet, just three-quarters of an inch or so, to about 365 degrees Fahrenheit.<s>
Catch you on the flip side.<s>
Wait.<s>
There we go.<s>
Cowabunga.<s>
Once your oil is around 365, you want to carefully fry your egg rolls in small batches for one to two minutes on each side, until golden brown.<s>
Now, we're talking.<s>
Be careful not to fry too many at once because the temperature will drop, and you'll end up with greasy egg rolls.<s>
You'll also run the risk of over boiling your oil.<s>
Drain your egg rolls.<s>
Then, I like to put them in a bowl that's lined with a paper towel, sort of upright, so that the excess oil can drip off.<s>
They actually stay pretty warm this way.<s>
Egg rolls are done.<s>
What time is it?<s>
It's egg roll time.<s>
What time is it?<s>
It's time for egg rolls.<s>
Those don't rhyme.<s>
So, I've got here some oriental hot mustard powder.<s>
You can find this in spice areas.<s>
Daisy, quit being such a bitch.<s>
You just mix up the powder with water to the desired consistency.<s>
I like mine a little bit thin so that it's good for dipping.<s>
Then, I've also got some sweet chili sauce.<s>
So, if you like this egg roll recipe, also check out my chimichangas for another delicious fried treat with a Mexican twist.<s>
I also did fresh spring rolls recipe a couple years ago that aren't fried, and they're way healthier and almost as delicious.<s>
With that said, let's give this a taste.<s>
I like this hot mustard.<s>
It's going to clear out my allergies.<s>
It's a fine crunchy egg roll.<s>
There you go.<s>
I hope you like this egg roll recipe.<s>

<transcript id="7" title="Filet-O-Fish Sandwich (Copy Cat Recipe) | Hilah Cooking " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNd3F68ou8k" mode="non-automatic">
Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking, we're making McDonald's knock off filet-o-fish sandwich.<s>
This is way better than the McDonald's version and I'm going to tell you a fun little story about how it got invented.<s>
And here's a hint.<s>
It has to do with Jesus.<s>
Okay to start out, duh, we're going to use some fish.<s>
I'm using tilapia.<s>
Try to get like as big of a fillet as you can, anything sort of firm will do well, like halibut or cod.<s>
And we're just going to try to cut it into squarish shapes so that it looks a little bit like McDonald's even though it's going to taste way better.<s>
So for this little interesting shaped thing here, it's already kind of starting to split there.<s>
So I'm just going to go ahead and cut it down the middle and then trim off like the little pointy end bits.<s>
Just to kind of try to kind of square it off a little bit and you can still like cook these and eat them like little fish nibbles or something, but they won't go on our sandwich because they're not perfect.<s>
So then these ones I'll cut in half, these ones, oh my god, my mom would be so ashamed of my language, sorry mom, bad grammar.<s>
So there, they're not exactly square, but they're rectangular and that's a type of squares guys.<s>
So then I'm going to just put them in a little bowl here, all the little pieces.<s>
Some of them are maybe too tiny and then squeeze some lemon juice over.<s>
Awesome.<s>
So that's just going to like brighten up the flavor a little bit, we're just going to let this marinate in the lemon juice for about ten minutes.<s>
In that time we can make our McDonald's rip-off tartar sauce.<s>
I just want to make sure all the little fishies get covered.<s>
If you don't have lemon, you could use a little bit of like white wine vinegar something, or tarragon vinegar would make it a fancy French filet-o-fish, filet-o-French and that would be something else entirely.<s>
Okay, I'm going to get set up and we'll make our tartar sauce while we wait on this marinade.<s>
Obviously tartar sauce starts with a mayonnaise base.<s>
Now if you would like a more fancy type of tartar sauce, I have a recipe for one with parsley and capers and garlic and all this other shit, on our website if you want to do that, but this is what I think is closest to the McDonald's tartar sauce which really just kind of tastes like pickles.<s>
So I just add a little pinch of salt, I'm going to add a little bit of white pepper.<s>
This is my unfancy touch.<s>
I'm sure it's not in the real thing, but it tastes really good.<s>
And then to make it look McDonaldsy, this is just some diced up like hamburger dill slices, just mince them up really tiny and then add in a little bit of that pickle juice in there too.<s>
So dump that in.<s>
Just dump it all in there.<s>
And then some super minced up white onion as well.<s>
And just like the tinier you can chop it the better.<s>
I'm a magician with a knife.<s>
You could use a food processor if you have bad skills.<s>
And we'll just mix it up.<s>
There's salt on my finger, better give it to the devil.<s>
Oh, that reminds me.<s>
So the story of the filet-o-fish: there was this guy in Ohio that had a franchise when McDonald's first started franchising and he wasn't making any money during Lent because his area was like 89 percent Catholic or something.<s>
So he like called Ronald McDonalds himself and he was like, look Don, sorry I mean Ron I'm not making any money over here in Ohio, I need to make a fish sandwich stat before I go broke.<s>
And Ronald McDonalds was like, I don't think so buddy.<s>
Then he tasted it and he was like, wow, this is the best sandwich ever, not better than my hamburgers, but you have my permission to put it on your menu and that saved his restaurant and then it went nationwide like the next year.<s>
So, there you go.<s>
It's time to bread the doughnuts, I mean the fish, I mean the doughnuts.<s>
Okay, so I drained the lemon juice off of the fish fillets and now I'm going to add some milk because milk is a wholesome thing and it does your body good; just enough to cover.<s>
Don't need to waste it, I'll drink that later.<s>
Some white Russians, okay.<s>
So just get them all in there, they're hanging out, that's fine.<s>
And then for the breading part, what I've done is I've mashed up some oyster crackers here until they're very, very fine.<s>
These are oyster crackers.<s>
They taste like saltines, but they look like oysters, I don't really know why they're called that, but that's a good enough reason I think.<s>
I like to use these when I'm breading stuff instead of saltines because one, they're cheaper than saltines by like a few cents, but I'm a frugal b-otch and also they're already in tiny pieces so they break up faster.<s>
So all I did was put some of them into this little zip top baggy and crushed them up until they're fairly fine.<s>
Most of them are powderish and I'm going to go ahead and add a little bit of plain dry bread crumbs to that too.<s>
If you wanted to just use bread crumbs, that's fine, but I felt like the crackers kind of gives it a better coating.<s>
So just mix that together and the crackers already have salt on them, so we don't need to add any salt to this, it's enough salt with just what's on the crackers.<s>
And now we're just going to do the standard milk, crackers, milk, crackers, plate.<s>
Okay, alright, fish fingers.<s>
Okay, once they're coated you want to put them in the fridge for at least ten minutes up to two or three hours, so you can make these ahead of time a little bit.<s>
That's going to help that coating adhere so that when we fry it, it doesn't just like fall off into the frying oil either.<s>
So I'll see you back in ten minutes.<s>
To fry the fish, I've got just under about a half inch of peanut oil here, you can use canola oil, vegetable oil, whatever, you know, stuff like that.<s>
And I've got it heated up to about 350.<s>
If you don't have a thermometer, you can just throw in a little bread crumb like this, just a crumb and it's all like, not it's not peeing, that's a sizzling sound.<s>
And we'll put our filets in.<s>
And you remember when I cut them up, I ended up with two that were a little bit thicker and two that were a little bit thinner.<s>
So the thicker ones obviously are going to take little bit longer to cook, so I don't know.<s>
It's kind of easier sometimes just to do them together, do the thicker ones together and then the thinner ones, but basically we're just going to cook these for about a minute on the first side, they'll be nice and golden brown.<s>
Flip them over, do another two minutes or so on the other side until that's golden brown and by then, the inside should be perfectly cooked and beautiful and flaky and moist like a fish sandwich.<s>
There we go.<s>
So just check it.<s>
The second side usually browns slower than the first so see, it's still pretty pale, so let it go maybe another minute or so.<s>
If you wanted to make these lower fat, you can also totally bake them.<s>
Just do the breading, spray it with a little bit of you know, spray oil or something, and bake it on like a tray with a rack like this.<s>
I'm going to use this for draining, but you can just bake it on here at 450 for about fifteen minutes.<s>
It's not going to get like as delectably golden brown as these, but it will be crispy and cooked and it will be much healthier than this or a McDonald's filet-o-fish.<s>
So, I should have taken a note myself, but...<s>
I just need to stand up straighter.<s>
Okay, there we go, now we're talking.<s>
So like I said, just drain it on a little rack over here.<s>
And I'll go ahead and fry my other fish.<s>
While those are cooling, I'll microwave a couple little hamburger buns to soften them up and get them nice and squishy like the ones at McDonalds.<s>
Okay.<s>
Okay, we're ready, to have fish sandwiches, fish sandwiches, fish sandwiches.<s>
I've got a little bun here, like I said I just stuck it in the microwave for literally ten seconds and it gets nice and pliable and warm.<s>
I'm going to top it with some American cheese.<s>
Now at McDonalds they're skimpy little bastards and they only give you half a slice of cheese.<s>
What the hell is American about that?<s>
So we're going to go ahead and do a whole slice, thank you very much.<s>
And then we'll top it with a little fish patty.<s>
Let's see, this one looks good and a big, big hefty blob of your tartar sauce.<s>
They do like this much there.<s>
I know, because I just ate one the other day.<s>
And then there you go.<s>
There's a gorgeous filet-o-fish sandwich for you.<s>
Then of course you would put the top on and eat it.<s>
If you like this recipe, also check out my Chick-Fil-A knock-off.<s>
If you like fried meat sandwiches and if you don't want to watch that one, then you can watch my chicken fried steak video because I do the same, a very similar cracker crust and you can just see how gorgeous it is.<s>
It's delicious.<s>
Fried meats for the win, right people?<s>
Okay.<s>
Give it a taste.<s>
That's what's supposed to happen, that little--shit, that's good.<s>
Do I have something on my face?<s>
I do.<s>
Alright, there you go, homemade filet-o-fish, way better than McDonalds.<s>
I hope you try this, I hope you love it.<s>
Please leave a comment below and visit me at hilahcooking.com for principle recipes.<s>
See you guys later, thanks for watching.<s>
Bye-bye.<s>
I'm going to try to fit this whole thing in my mouth.<s>

<transcript id="8" title="Fish Tacos Recipe |  Tacos De Pescado " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LjKf4YxMk4" mode="non-automatic">
Hey dudes, I'm Hilah and today I'm Hilah cooking and remaking the second recipe video I ever did.<s>
That is Fish Tacos.<s>
Can you believe it's been that long since I ate some Fish Tacos?<s>
I mean, come on.<s>
So, this is a great summertime recipe.<s>
It comes together in a cinch.<s>
It's nice.<s>
It's refreshing.<s>
It's light so that you can keep your beach body figure.<s>
It's totally working on me.<s>
So I'm really excited to share it with you, especially because that old video, the sound was totally f'ed up, dudes.<s>
Time to get hoppin' on the Fish Taco toppin'.<s>
Taco Toppin' was actually the old Aztec name for this.<s>
So I'm going to update my slaw a little bit.<s>
I've got some green cabbage that I shredded up, some white onion that sliced, and some jicama.<s>
So this is a root.<s>
It's starchy.<s>
It has a texture like a raw potato, but it's sweet like an apple and mild.<s>
So it adds a nice little flavor to the slaw.<s>
I've got that in there.<s>
And then I'm going to add some salt.<s>
This is a super duper simple coleslaw recipe.<s>
All we're going to use is salt and lime juice to get it softened up to get that cabbage releasing some water, and get it nice and tender so we can eat it raw.<s>
Everyone's on this raw diet thing.<s>
Whatever.<s>
But some raw vegetables obviously are good for you.<s>
Like salad.<s>
Like celery sticks.<s>
Like carrot sticks.<s>
So that's about a teaspoon of salt.<s>
I'll get that tossed around with my tongs.<s>
You could use your hands also, nature's tongs.<s>
Use a bigger bowl than I did so you don't have to worry about it flopping out everywhere.<s>
So salt's coating everything.<s>
Now we're just going to squeeze in some lime juice.<s>
And if you are be stricken by horribly high lime prices, you can use some lemon juice.<s>
Just don't tell anyone.<s>
I really expected more juice from that lime, since I paid 33 cents for it.<s>
Hopefully that was close to two tablespoons.<s>
We'll get that tossed around.<s>
Toss that salad.<s>
And then I'm going to add some cilantro, or fresh coriander, if you are British.<s>
And I don't bother pulling off the stems for cilantro.<s>
I just chop it up really really fine because there's a lot of flavor in the stems actually.<s>
So I can see with my little eyes that the cabbage has already started to soften up just with that little bit of motion in the ocean, so I'm just going to set this aside and work on some other stuff and just leave it at room temperature, and I'll show you what it looks like when we're done.<s>
You'll be amazed.<s>
You'll be like wow, you're a genius.<s>
For the mayonnaise sauce, this is an update, I've got some mayonnaise here.<s>
I'm going to add some minced chipotle peppers.<s>
So chipotle and adobo, they come in a little can, it's a dollar, and it's the adobo sauce that's sweet and slightly vinegary, but mostly sweet.<s>
And hot.<s>
There's smoked jalapeno peppers, and then they're put in this adobo sauce.<s>
So whenever I get a jar home, I like to transfer it into a jar and keep it in the fridge, and then they'll stay like that forever.<s>
So they're pretty spicy.<s>
I'm going to start with half of one and just mince it up, and it pretty much just turns into a paste as you're mincing it.<s>
I'm just going to put all of it in there.<s>
I like it spicy.<s>
All minced up, it's about a tablespoon of chipotle in adobo.<s>
Plop that in with some mayonnaise.<s>
Lick your finger, because who cares.<s>
I'm only cooking for myself and this guy, and he doesn't give a sh**.<s>
I'm going to add some lime juice.<s>
So about a tablespoon of that.<s>
And I'm going to add a little bit of malt vinegar, which is really really good on fried fish.<s>
It smells vinegary, but it's nutty and sweet.<s>
Anyway, if you can't find this, then you can just add some more lime juice.<s>
It's just going to add some more tartness.<s>
But also it's nice because of the whole fish connection.<s>
Then we're going to mix this up.<s>
So the sourness of the vinegar and the lime juice should balance out the heat of the chipotle pretty well, but if it's a little bit too spicy for you, I would recommend that you add a little bit of honey or sugar to temper that heat a little bit.<s>
But this tastes pretty good to me.<s>
Thumbs up.<s>
So we'll just set this aside and start working on the fish.<s>
So, I haven't changed anything from the original recipe as far as the seasoning and the spices that I'm putting on it.<s>
So the two main things here are some cumin seeds and some anise.<s>
This is not star anise.<s>
It's just anise seed.<s>
And it has a licoricey fennely flavor.<s>
If you can't find it you can leave it out, but it goes really really nicely with fish.<s>
And then whole cumin seed.<s>
So those two.<s>
And some chili powder.<s>
And when I say chili powder, me, personally, I just mean ground up ancho chilies, or ground up New Mexico chilies.<s>
I don't mean commercial brand of chili powder that has garlic salt and all that stuff mixed into it, although if that's what you can find, and that's what you have in your pantry, that is totally totally fine.<s>
Please don't worry about it.<s>
A little mortar and pestle.<s>
You can use pre-ground spices if you want, but you know me, I like to make things hard on myself.<s>
So put our whole spices in and crush them up.<s>
Good.<s>
And then I'm going to add my chili powder.<s>
It's already ground.<s>
And salt and pepper.<s>
What's life without salt and pepper.<s>
You wouldn't have that song, Push It, for one thing.<s>
Mixed up.<s>
Now for the breading part, I'm just using some cornmeal.<s>
If you are in another country that's not the best country in the world, America.<s>
If you are in another country and you don't have cornmeal, you can use fine polenta.<s>
It's basically the same thing.<s>
We're going to add this to that, and mix it around.<s>
It's combined.<s>
Now we're going to do the fish.<s>
So, I do the fish last so I don't have to wash my cutting board between.<s>
I'm not getting raw fish juice on things.<s>
I'm using some wild snapper, but you can use pretty much any lightish fish.<s>
You could probably use salmon or something like that too.<s>
Any old kind of fish that you like.<s>
And I asked the fish monger if he could skin it for me, so these are skinless and boneless.<s>
So, I'm just going to cut them into pieces, maybe an inch wide by however long it is, so that usually ends up being about the right size to go into a taco.<s>
So you got your fish chunks.<s>
Now we're just going to toss them around in this cornmeal mixture just to coat it.<s>
We don't really need anything to help adhere the cornmeal, just the moisture from the fish will keep it on there.<s>
And you can do this fish coating part ahead of time too and just cover them and leave them in the fridge up to a couple hours and then it'll help the coating stick on better too.<s>
But you can leave them sit for awhile.<s>
So the fish is all coated.<s>
I'm just going to let it sit here in my little dish for just as long as it takes to heat up a skillet with some oil in it and then we'll get to fry in the fish.<s>
Fish fry party.<s>
So you want to heat your pan up over medium, or medium high heat, and then add maybe two tablespoons of canola oil or corn oil or peanut oil, something neutral, with a high smoke point.<s>
Swirl it around like a lava lamp.<s>
Don't get all high and get distracted.<s>
And then you want to cook your fish in two batches.<s>
Cook the smaller pieces with the smaller pieces and the bigger ones with the bigger ones.<s>
And when you lay it in the hot oil, lay it away from you, just in case, so you don't splatter hot oil on your beautiful face and make Jesus very sad.<s>
So they'll probably just take about two to three minutes on each side depending on the size.<s>
And with thicker filets like this snapper, you might need to do more than just two sides and go ahead and get the sides, sides cooked as well.<s>
Once they're nice and brown on every side we can take them out.<s>
And when you break one open the inside should be flaky, like that.<s>
And these are super duper hot right now so you want to let them cool off for a few minutes, and while that's happening we can heat up our tortillas.<s>
Put some of that on there.<s>
Some of our chipotle mayo sauce.<s>
So if you're interested, be sure to check out the original Fish Taco video for some really hilarious Fish Taco jokes.<s>
And also make sure to check out HilahCooking.com for this printable recipe and all of my recipes.<s>
And if you make this, please tag me on Instagram or Twitter and send me a picture, because I'd love to see that.<s>
Look at that.<s>
It's so gorgeous.<s>
So colorful.<s>
I did it again.<s>
You're welcome.<s>
Thank you for watching.<s>
Have a great day.<s>
Bye.<s>

<transcript id="9" title="Greek Pasta Salad  + Tour of My New House! " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFs5PSdZ7u0" mode="non-automatic">
Hey Dudes I'm Hilah and today on Hilah Cooking, look, I'm in a brand new kitchen.<s>
So long orange countertops.<s>
Hello, a brand new house with white cabinets and lots of natural light and looks like rich people live here.<s>
So, I'm going to make some Greek Pasta Salad today.<s>
This is a great thing for all your summer time potlucks.<s>
Fathers Day is coming up might be a nice thing to take out for that and then after we make the recipe, I'm going to give you a tour of our new house and tell you a little bit about this watermelon that I ate.<s>
The first thing for the pasta salad is we need to cook some pasta and now, one thing I've been meaning to talk to you all about, I've got about a quart of water almost to a boil here.<s>
You really don't need to use like six quarts of water when you're making pasta.<s>
I wrote a big thing about water conservation on my website.<s>
If you want to go read some tips about how to save water because it's our most precious natural resource.<s>
I said that sarcastically but I mean it so, anyway, you need about a quart of water to cook two cups of pasta or 1/2 a pound which is what we're going to do now.<s>
The reason that people tell you to use a whole sh** ton of water like that is so that the pasta doesn't stick together but as long as you're kind of standing here for the first minute or so while the pasta goes in and you can kind of stir it around a little bit and then it's not going to stick together.<s>
So I'm going to add some salt to my water.<s>
So, you basically just want to stir until it comes back to a boil which will take 30 seconds to a minute so you can put the lid back on for maybe 10 or 15 seconds to help it come back to a boil faster but don't walk off because it will boil over if you do that.<s>
So, once it's boiling and you want to set the timer.<s>
My pasta package said 9 to 11 minutes.<s>
I'm going to split the difference which is ten and then subtract two, so I'm going to set it for eight minutes.<s>
I did it.<s>
So, I've got my green beans while that's boiling, I'm going to go ahead... you want to snap the little stem ends off these and I don't bother like snapping off the little string ends because I think they're kind of cute.<s>
So, once you've got all your green beans snapped.<s>
Just chop them all into about one inch lengths.<s>
I'm going to set them in this little bowl.<s>
Get them the hell out of my way.<s>
Once our time goes off which is just in about two minutes, I'm going to add the green beans and then let the pasta and green beans boil together for the last two minutes.<s>
That's going to sort of blanch the green beans and let the pasta finish cooking.<s>
Then you just want to drain the pasta and the green beans and give them a quick rinse with some cold water You're not really trying to cool them off so much as you are trying to rinse off some excess starch so that they don't stick together.<s>
We're just going to leave those draining in the sink while I get the other stuff prepped up so I've got some fresh parsley.<s>
I'm not going to be too anal about like not leaving any stems behind.<s>
No stem left behind.<s>
Just sort of pull off the big leaves and we're going to give it a rough chop.<s>
So, just sort of wad it up into a little ball and don't cut your fingers, and then I've got some Kalamata olives and I've already chopped up some sweet peppers and some tomatoes here, as you can see, You can buy presliced Kalamata olives but I find that they get a little bit mushy so I like to buy the ones that are just pitted and whole and then I'm just going to cut them in half.<s>
Yeah, let's just cut them in half.<s>
That's easier for everyone.<s>
So then, we're going to work on the dressing so that's going to require a clove of garlic.<s>
Just get it minced up then in a bowl here I'm going to put this garlic.<s>
See if I can do this.<s>
This is stupid.<s>
Ta-da.<s>
So I've got my garlic in a large bowl, I'm going to add olive oil.<s>
About two tablespoons of that and then I'm going to add some white wine vinegar.<s>
You can use red wine vinegar.<s>
You can use cider vinegar.<s>
So I'm going to add a couple of tablespoons to this and traditional vinaigrette is three parts oil to one part acid like vinegar or lemon juice.<s>
I like mine a little bit more forceful.<s>
I like my vinaigrette to really take control so I'm going to do one to one ratio but feel free to adjust it a little bit according to your taste.<s>
Get that kind of mixed up then some black pepper of course and some salt and the real kicker here, some oregano and that's what makes it Greek.<s>
I'm going to add a whole teaspoon.<s>
Get that mixed up.<s>
Now let me go grab the pasta, just dump that on in.<s>
I'm going to use a wooden spoon so I don't hurt you're delicate ears.<s>
Sweet viewers.<s>
So I toss this all around then we can add our other vegetables and whatever else you want to add to this.<s>
Cucumbers may be good too.<s>
Red onion, whatever.<s>
Have a pasta party.<s>
So this is why too, when you're making pasta for pasta salad you want to undercook it just a tiny bit, take it off the heat just moments before it would be tender enough to serve hot because then once you cool it off and mix it with your vinaigrette it's going to absorb some of that vinaigrette and it makes it way delicious if it has some room to absorb some of that.<s>
Also, it would be really soggy if you cooked it completely before you did that.<s>
So then once everything is mixed up together, cooled off, then we're going to add the last ingredient which you can totally omit if you are a vegan or you are some parmesan cheese instead too and that's some crumbled feta cheese.<s>
Just a little bit, couple of tablespoons there we have it.<s>
We're done.<s>
So, you could serve this right now at room temperature or you could refrigerate.<s>
It lasts in the fridge for couple of days.<s>
Let me get a fork because I'm going to eat it.<s>
So if you like this recipe I also did a potato salad last year so that's also really great.<s>
I did coleslaw, like a vinaigrette coleslaw that's also good because it doesn't have mayonnaise so like if it's sitting out in the sun, it's not going to get all poisonous on you, kill your children.<s>
Da**it, that is good.<s>
Good as hell and I hope you try it.<s>
Okay, than there you go.<s>
Thank you so much for watching.<s>
Printable Recipes are always at hilahcooking.com.<s>
But, hey, guess what, remember what I told you?<s>
House tour time.<s>
I'm going to take this pasta and show you around the house.<s>
Let's go.<s>
Here's the kitchen pretty much saw that already.<s>
Okay then after the kitchen there is this sort of nook, we've got our bar, some booze in it, some random sh** that we haven't figured out what to do with and then all of my cookbook collection.<s>
You want to see my favorite cookbook?<s>
It's this one.<s>
It's the one I wrote.<s>
Okay, then here's the living room.<s>
More books, some other artwork we don't know what to do with and then look.<s>
World's largest dog bed.<s>
The dogs really enjoy this couch.<s>
Chris and I usually just end up sitting on the floor because they are such space hogs.<s>
Just kidding.<s>
We all cuddle together and it's really cute.<s>
Okay and here we went from about 1700 square feet to about 1200 square feet which is a way more manageable number, I think.<s>
Bathroom, so we're selling our old place and we're just renting this place.<s>
This is the baby room.<s>
Guess what, guys?<s>
I lied, I did not eat a watermelon.<s>
I'm having a baby because I had sex.<s>
Okay, so having sex makes you have a baby.<s>
So kids, listen up.<s>
We're having a boy.<s>
Fortunately, the room was already painted this nice turquoise color and had these window treatments that totally matched our Pee Wee Herman poster.<s>
Oh, also, the landlady left the crib for us.<s>
So we were like, "Dude, free crib.<s>
" We have to get this place.<s>
And, oh, prenatal yoga bolsters.<s>
We're going to be doing so prenatal yoga that.<s>
Okay, this is where the magic happens.<s>
This is where the baby got made.<s>
Not in this room but on this bed This is also where Daisy can often be found and this is why, got wooden floors and we had to get rug over here so that Daisy could get some traction so she could jump up on the bed in the morning and wake us up.<s>
She was just slipping and sliding.<s>
It was so sad and cute.<s>
Okay, so let's go look at the back yard and see if we can see the dogs doing something cute.<s>
Look how big my butt's getting.<s>
Guys.<s>
"Boom, boom, boom.<s>
" Looks like a Godzilla butt.<s>
Well, that rug is slippery.<s>
Be careful.<s>
Oh yeah, so it's got a big old deck.<s>
Hey guys and it came with a swing set.<s>
Guys go be cute for the camera.<s>
Go run around and play.<s>
So yeah, basically, there's our new house.<s>
We moved because we're having a baby and I wanted a nicer neighborhood that we could like walk around in so this is really good.<s>
We're still in Austin but its way more central and there's like parks and little shops we can walk to, so I don't have to load up the car every time I want to take the baby somewhere and it came with a swing set and a crib.<s>
So how can we say, no.<s>
Okay, that's it.<s>

<transcript id="10" title="Healthy Recipes- Blueberry Protein Pancakes " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaPX7_KslTo" mode="non-automatic">
I'm Natalie Hodson, here today in the bodybuilding.com kitchen showing you how to make a recipe that I make a lot of mornings, and it's my Blueberry Protein Pancake.<s>
This is a really good recipe.<s>
If you're getting tired of the same old egg whites and oats.<s>
This uses the exact same ingredients.<s>
It just mixes them into a different way.<s>
I know there's a lot of protein pancake recipes out there, but I like this one because it uses all whole foods and it tastes really good.<s>
These are all the ingredients that we're gonna use for today's recipe.<s>
We're gonna use 6 egg whites, and 1/2 cup of old fashion oats.<s>
I like the old fashion oats better than the instant oats just because they're a little bit less processed.<s>
The instant oats have actually been cooked and dehydrated to make them cook faster, and these haven't.<s>
They've just been rolled.<s>
We have 1/4 cup of blueberries.<s>
You can use fresh or frozen or you can substitute it for raspberries or strawberries.<s>
We have 1/2 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk.<s>
And just make sure that when you get the almond milk, you're getting the unsweetened vanilla kind.<s>
I like the Almond Breeze brand.<s>
It's 40 calories, has no sugar in it.<s>
Also, if you wanted, you could substitute milk, but I prefer the almond milk.<s>
And then we have 1 teaspoon of baking powder.<s>
This is just to help the pancakes rise a little bit.<s>
Two packets of Truvia.<s>
This is to make them a little bit sweeter.<s>
I have 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and just a dash of cinnamon.<s>
And those two items we're gonna save 'til the end and use it as a topping on top of the pancakes.<s>
So for today's recipe, I'm actually gonna use a blender to mix everything together.<s>
And I'm gonna start with my liquid ingredients.<s>
Gonna pour in my almond milk, and then I'm going to do my egg whites.<s>
And I'm just gonna crack these right into the blender.<s>
Now some people just throw their yolks away into the trash can.<s>
I actually like to put mine in the garbage disposal, and I found that out the hard way.<s>
I used to just throw my yolks into the trash can, and one day I came home and my house smelled really bad and I couldn't figure out why.<s>
And it's because I left the yolks in the trash can for too long, and so now what I do is I'll just put them right into the garbage disposal.<s>
Some people like to feed the egg yolks to their dog, and I guess that helps with their coat and makes it a little bit shinier.<s>
And this is a really good breakfast recipe if you have kids.<s>
I have a 2 year-old and he loves this recipe.<s>
We eat it a couple times a week.<s>
And it's a really good way to incorporate some whole grains into their diet, and the blueberries has some really good antioxidants.<s>
Another thing you can do is you can make these in bulk on the weekend, and then freeze them.<s>
I think they taste a little bit better fresh but you definitely can freeze them.<s>
And when I do that I just put them in a Ziploc bag and then when I wanna eat them, I stick them in the microwave for about a minute.<s>
Alright.<s>
So we have 6 egg whites.<s>
Then I'm just gonna add my oats.<s>
And I'm gonna save the blueberries until we're actually in the griddle.<s>
I'm gonna add my baking powder.<s>
I'm just gonna do a dash of salt.<s>
It's probably about 1/8 of a teaspoon if you were to measure it.<s>
And then two packets of Truvia.<s>
If you want to eat the pancakes without any applesauce on top, you could add a third pack of Truvia.<s>
It would make your pancakes sweet so you wouldn't need to add the applesauce on top.<s>
And then I'm just gonna blend this really fast.<s>
Alright.<s>
I'm quickly gonna turn my skillet on to about medium-high heat.<s>
Then I'm just gonna spray it with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray.<s>
And then I'm just gonna take my batter and--this recipe makes two pancakes.<s>
Two pancakes is one serving so usually just kinda eyeball it.<s>
And put about half of the batter in the skillet, and then I'm gonna take half of my blueberries and just drop them in the top.<s>
You can blend these, the blueberries, in too if you want.<s>
I've done that before, but I think it tastes a little better this way.<s>
Makes them a little bit juicier.<s>
So we're just gonna let this cook.<s>
Usually you can tell they're ready to flip when there's bubbles in the center of the pancake.<s>
So I went ahead and flipped the pancake.<s>
We've been cooking it about 1 to 2 minutes on each side.<s>
And sometimes the first pancake doesn't flip quite as well as the second pancake, and it's because sometimes in the blender the egg whites tend to kinda stay at the top and the oats fall to the bottom, but this one turned out pretty good.<s>
So I'm just gonna take the pancake and put it on my plate.<s>
I'll flip it I guess.<s>
That side's not quite as pretty.<s>
And then I'm gonna go ahead and put my second pancake in.<s>
I'm just gonna blend it for just a second to get everything shaken up.<s>
Gonna spray my pan with the spray.<s>
Then I'm just gonna pour the rest of my batter in.<s>
Make sure to get all those oats out.<s>
And I'm gonna add the rest of my blueberries.<s>
And we're just gonna let it cook about 1 to 2 minutes per side.<s>
You know it's ready to flip once the edges look like they're cooked all the way through and there's bubbles starting to form in the center of the pancake.<s>
Alright.<s>
So we are done cooking our second pancake.<s>
I'm gonna go ahead and put it on the plate.<s>
Oops.<s>
As you can see, this is a lot of food.<s>
This is another reason I like this recipe is 'cause it's really great way to start the day with a nice hearty meal.<s>
And then--the pancakes are really sweet on their own I think, and so a lot of times I'll actually eat these even without any applesauce on top.<s>
You can use sugar free syrup if you want, but I prefer to stay away from that just because it has a lot of preservatives in it.<s>
So sometimes if I want a little extra something on top, I'll use some unsweetened applesauce.<s>
Just make sure you get the applesauce that says no sugar added or unsweetened or if you read the ingredient list, the only ingredients are apples, water, and maybe ascorbic acid which helps keep the coloring.<s>
So I'm just gonna go with this half of a cup of applesauce.<s>
I'm just gonna pour it on top.<s>
Sometimes I like to put a little bit underneath.<s>
And then I like cinnamon so I'm gonna put a dash of cinnamon on top.<s>
You don't have to do that if you don't like cinnamon.<s>
Sprinkle a little cinnamon on top and there you go.<s>
You have a really good breakfast.<s>
One serving is 2 pancakes, and each serving has 6 egg whites, and 1/2 a cup of oats, some blueberries, and some almond milk.<s>

<transcript id="11" title="Healthy Recipes- Cacao Kale Chips " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqRyRIIfFTQ" mode="non-automatic">
Okay, so today I'm here with Maureen and Bria--my client Maureen and her daughter, she's 10 years old.<s>
Maureen is 38.<s>
And so we're gonna be doing kale chips, cacao kale chips.<s>
This was my little phenomenal recipe that I developed.<s>
They're just grabbing two bunches of kale chips--raw, organic kale.<s>
And taking off the leafs, putting it in here.<s>
So I'm gonna let them work away at that.<s>
So kale is a super food.<s>
You know, people always ask, "What's a super food?<s>
" There isn't one super food, but this is definitely a very nutritious food, and it's got a lot of phytonutrients, disease-fighting properties, which is what we want.<s>
So cacao kale chips, again, two bunches of kale, you've got coconut oil.<s>
And again, another oil of your choice.<s>
You can do, even, an almond oil if you want.<s>
I have almond meal, as well.<s>
Then I have some stevia and organic cacao powder that we're gonna be mixing in.<s>
So with kale chips, a lot of times I see people on social media posting, you know, that they put them in their oven, put them at 350.<s>
That is a choice for you, you can do that for about 10 or 15 minutes.<s>
However, I'm gonna tell you the importance of why getting a dehydrator is actually gonna help with getting those nutrients in.<s>
So I have my Excalibur with me, which Santa brought to me 2 years ago.<s>
And thankful for that.<s>
The importance of a dehydrator is it doesn't kill the enzymes.<s>
And the enzymes are so important because it keeps the nutrients alive.<s>
The whole reason we're eating vegetables is because of the powerhouse foods that they are.<s>
So when you're cooking them above a certain level, you're actually killing all the nutrients.<s>
So again, I'm 40 years old, I didn't have all these tools when I was in my 20s or 30s, so it's, you know, over time I've made an investment in certain pieces of equipment that have actually helped my kitchen and the foods I eat work better for me.<s>
So, Maureen, how do you incorporate kale for your family?<s>
Well, for Bria I put it on her sandwich for school for her lunch.<s>
And at home, just for dinner instead of lettuce, or I even mix it with other types of lettuce, spinach or mustard greens.<s>
And we can have it in a salad, we can have it with turkey burger, chicken.<s>
That sounds good.<s>
I'm gonna have to get some recipes from you.<s>
Okay, so Bria, do you like kale.<s>
Yeah.<s>
You don't, like, throw it in the garbage 'cause you're at school and Mom can't see that you're not eating it?<s>
No, I eat it in my sandwich.<s>
Very good, very good.<s>
So there you have it, a great way to get kale in for your kids to enjoy it.<s>
So let's go ahead, if you wanna go ahead and grab the other ingredients here.<s>
Let's get the almond meal in here.<s>
I'm gonna help these guys while they're going ahead and getting off all the leafs.<s>
So again, I'm putting in a couple tablespoons here.<s>
So, like I said, measuring great, but overtime, you know, an extra tablespoon or 2, it's not gonna hurt you.<s>
You wanna put some stevia?<s>
Go ahead and sprinkle that in.<s>
So again, some stevia to taste.<s>
And then I've got the cacao powder.<s>
So again, if you love chocolate, it's great.<s>
And then I'm gonna go ahead and pour the oil in.<s>
Again, you can measure and do a couple tablespoons, but again I want all that powder to stick.<s>
Three people making kale chips.<s>
This is a good workout for the arms.<s>
Okay.<s>
We good?<s>
Awesome.<s>
So here, I love these mixing bowls, they're my favorite.<s>
Okay, who wants to shake it up?<s>
You're the dancing queen, let's go.<s>
Shake it up.<s>
There we go!<s>
Fun in the kitchen with Bria and Maureen.<s>
So, when they're done, you're gonna see, like I said, you can put 'em in the oven.<s>
And I'm gonna have you scoot forward here.<s>
So why don't you go ahead, open that up, let them see.<s>
So this is how they look.<s>
And you can kind of mix it up a little bit more.<s>
But when they're done, they're nice and crispy.<s>
And a crunch--they're so good.<s>
So good.<s>
Go ahead, grab one.<s>
Delicious.<s>
So thanks for joining us on "Nicole's Healthy Minutes.<s>

<transcript id="12" title="Healthy Recipes- Chocolate Peanut Butter Protein Crisps - Bars " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlJPzEmQFGM" mode="non-automatic">
[music] Hi, I'm Jamie Eason and today I'm in the BODYBUILDING.COM kitchen and I'm showing you how to make my chocolate peanut butter protein crisps.<s>
In a previous video I showed you how to make my honey, almond, protein crisps.<s>
But now we're gonna use two of my other favorite ingredients: chocolate and peanut butter.<s>
So, let's get started.<s>
The ingredients for our chocolate, peanut butter, protein crisps are three cups of a crispy brown rice, we've got 1 cup of whole oats, a scoop of a vanilla whey protein powder, we've got some crushed almonds, some peanut butter right here, some cocoa, and some brown sugar, and somewhere around here I've got my honey.<s>
That's all you're gonna need, so let's get started.<s>
To start I've put 3 cups of the crispy brown rice.<s>
And just so you see.<s>
You can have a reference.<s>
This is the crispy brown rice I used.<s>
It's gluten-free, organic.<s>
It's got very few ingredients in it.<s>
It does have a little bit of sugar.<s>
It's natural sugar.<s>
It's got organic molasses and evaporated cane juice.<s>
But it's 2 grams per serving.<s>
There's 3/4 of a cup in a serving, so you've got less than 5 grams of natural sugar in the whole entire recipe, so not bad.<s>
It makes 18 servings.<s>
So, we've started with that, put that in.<s>
And then I've got my cup of whole oats.<s>
I'm gonna put that on top.<s>
And then I'm gonna add 1/4 cup of crushed almonds.<s>
So, if you don't have crushed almonds, you can actually just take your own almonds, you know, scoop out 1/4 of a cup of those and just beat them with a rolling pin.<s>
You can use the back of a pot, whatever you have.<s>
And then, on top of that I'm gonna add 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein powder.<s>
I kind of sprinkle that on top, spread it around a bit.<s>
Now, do not mix this up.<s>
We don't want to make all of the protein powder settle to the bottom.<s>
So, I just give it a gentle shake and then I'm gonna set it to the side.<s>
So, now I'm gonna switch out to a smaller bowl and in this bowl--now make sure you use a glass bowl.<s>
That's important because we're gonna need to put it in the microwave.<s>
So, we're gonna start out with our main ingredient, which is an all natural, unsalted creamy peanut butter.<s>
You can use chunky if you like, but the chunky actually doesn't seem to mix up quite as well.<s>
But I have made it and it tastes really good too.<s>
So, it's just your preference.<s>
There's a lot of natural oil that comes up from the peanuts, so we're gonna pour a little bit of that off.<s>
Don't pour it all out though, because you'll really have a hard time mixing it up.<s>
So, I'm gonna go ahead and mix it--see, it's already kind of hard.<s>
Let's see.<s>
I have to get the muscle in there.<s>
Mix it up a bit.<s>
Alright.<s>
And so, we're gonna actually take 3/4 of a cup of a creamy, all natural peanut butter and add that to the bowl.<s>
So, I like to use my little smaller scoop.<s>
I think it's more manageable, but you can use a measuring cup and just measure to 3/4.<s>
So, I'm going to scoop it out and put it in there.<s>
This one looks slightly chunky, slightly smooth, so I think I needed to maybe stir it up a little longer.<s>
Sometimes I've been known to heat it up a little bit in the microwave just to get it going, but--let's see.<s>
So, we've got our 1/4 going.<s>
Do some more.<s>
And you don't have to be super, super careful with the measurements in this actual recipe.<s>
You can add a little, take away a little if you want.<s>
I've actually figured out the ratios just to have just enough so you don't have to--they don't end up too dry, 'cause we want them to stick together a bit.<s>
We're trying to make that crispy rice and everything kind of all come together, so that when we freeze it, it actually makes this crunchy, crispy, kind of granola.<s>
I've almost got it all out.<s>
This one's more challenging that the almond butter.<s>
Now, with that said, you could use the almond butter if you'd like.<s>
And you can actually add extracts.<s>
So, if you wanted to make say chocolate with like a little bit of orange--hint of orange or something or there's coconut extracts.<s>
There's bananas--maybe chocolate, peanut butter, banana might be pretty good.<s>
You could actually use little pieces of banana if you'd like too.<s>
But they will get a little mushy and that'll make it not stick together as well.<s>
So, use that sparingly or do the dried bananas.<s>
But, again, that's added sugar, so just be careful about how much you're using, 'cause we're already using quite a bit of natural sugar.<s>
Next thing I'm gonna add is gonna be my honey.<s>
So, we're gonna do 1/2 cup of honey.<s>
So, since this is my 1/4 measuring scoop I'm gonna do 2 of these.<s>
So, we've got one.<s>
Need my little spatula.<s>
Now, honey is really, really, really good for you.<s>
I'm often asked about honey versus agave and if agave is better.<s>
I personally prefer honey.<s>
I think there's so many health benefits to it with the antioxidants.<s>
And it's good for your skin.<s>
It's a good antibacterial.<s>
There's just so many great things about it that I'd prefer to use it, 'cause agave in truth it'll still spike your blood sugar.<s>
So, be careful because a lot of times some of those labels can be misleading and make you think that that's a better choice, but it actually still pretty much does the same thing.<s>
So, alright, we've got those two ingredients in the bowl and now I'm gonna add 1/2 cup actually of xylitol brown sugar blend.<s>
Xylitol is a sweetener.<s>
It comes from like raspberries, plums.<s>
It's a natural fructose sweetener.<s>
And it's actually a sugar alcohol.<s>
It does not have quite as many calories as regular sugar, but it still will have a slight insulin spike.<s>
It's just a little bit better for you.<s>
It is organic.<s>
It is natural.<s>
They actually use it in toothpaste 'cause it's good for our teeth.<s>
So, I'm gonna dump that in.<s>
and the brown sugar part adds a little bit of molasses flavor to what we're making.<s>
If you really prefer, you can look for something like organic sucanat, which it has 15 calories per teaspoon.<s>
So you're adding some calories, but it's less sweetness as far as like less grams of sugar, but it also tastes less sweet.<s>
So, you might end up having to use more.<s>
So, for me I just like to use this and just kind of eat it sparingly, so.<s>
Alright.<s>
Into that I want to add--let's see we've got vanilla.<s>
I'm gonna do a teaspoon of vanilla.<s>
And then I'm going to add my chocolate.<s>
Now, the chocolate the preference is up to you.<s>
You can add a couple tablespoons.<s>
You can add a lot of tablespoons.<s>
You can use dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate, whatever kind you'd like to use.<s>
Some people like cacao.<s>
You could use anything you'd like.<s>
So, I'm gonna open that up.<s>
Let's do 3 of those.<s>
I prefer for the recipe to use dark chocolate.<s>
So, if you can find the unsweetened dark chocolate, I think that's probably your best bet.<s>
So, I'm gonna stir this up just a little bit just to get the dry stuff incorporated a little.<s>
And then we want to stick this in the microwave for just about 30 seconds just to kind of soften it up.<s>
So, I can stir it all together.<s>
Alright, let's stir this together a bit.<s>
You want to get all of the dry ingredients incorporated into the wet, so it's doing pretty well.<s>
You might have to stick it in there for maybe another 30 seconds to really get it pliable.<s>
I think I'm gonna do that with--when you add all of the cocoa and everything it's not quite as liquefied as one of the other recipes that we made like the honey, almond, protein crisps.<s>
So, let me stick that back in for 30 more seconds.<s>
Don't do the minute all at once, because you could burn your chocolate and we definitely don't want that.<s>
Alright.<s>
Let's stir this together a bit.<s>
Yeah, that's much easier to stir.<s>
So, now that I've got it all out, I'm gonna go ahead and pour that on top of our dry ingredients.<s>
There we go.<s>
Now it's pouring.<s>
It smells really good.<s>
I could probably just eat the chocolate and peanut butter, but--let's see.<s>
This one I don't share with my dog, 'cause she can't have chocolate.<s>
So, I'm gonna fold the dry ingredients over the top.<s>
I like to do the little folding technique, 'cause it keeps my spatula from getting too sticky right off the bat.<s>
Alright.<s>
And it doesn't look like much.<s>
You have to really work it to start getting all the wet ingredients incorporated into the dry.<s>
So, it might take a little bit of work, a little bit of muscle.<s>
So, I think I've almost got it all done.<s>
If you can see the protein powder still in there, you've got to probably keep stirring, which I can.<s>
So, I'm gonna keep going a second.<s>
It might look a bit dry and you don't want to add a lot of liquid though, because if you do, it'll end up getting too soft and fall apart.<s>
So, I think it looks pretty good.<s>
Now, we end up putting this in the freezer so it can get hard, but do know that after a while if you take it out of the freezer, it's gonna get softer and softer and it still tastes awesome.<s>
It's just not quite the same texture, because of course the peanut butter and everything softens up a little bit.<s>
So, I think we're good.<s>
And I'm gonna show you first and foremost how I make like one of the shapes.<s>
I brought just a little circle, 'cause that's a pretty easy one to demonstrate with.<s>
And I brought a pan.<s>
You don't need to prep your pan or do anything.<s>
You can just use your little circle.<s>
And then you just really you take a little bit in your fingers, push it down in there.<s>
It takes a little bit of time, but it's really pretty simple.<s>
And then you just want to firmly pack it in there.<s>
And as you push it all in then just gently kind of take the little loop off.<s>
You can see how it turns out.<s>
Turns out like that.<s>
And when it hardens up, it stays that way.<s>
And it's really nice you can pack them up.<s>
You can stack them together and wrap them up if you'd like.<s>
So, let me do another one of those.<s>
You could maybe alternate flavors.<s>
Do one kind of crisp and then do a different kind of flavored crisp.<s>
Alright, so I packed that in there.<s>
Wiggle it a little bit and there we go.<s>
So, I would fill up the rest of the tray and then stick that in the freezer.<s>
And I'm gonna finish working on these.<s>
Whatever I have left I'm gonna put in here and then I'll come right back.<s>
[music] Okay, the chocolate, peanut butter, protein crisp has been in the freezer for about an hour, so we're gonna go take that out.<s>
They look great.<s>
I took out the ones that we cut into shapes.<s>
So, now they're nice and frozen and solid, so.<s>
If you are making this and you actually keep it in one big dish, it makes about a serving of eighteen.<s>
For a single serving of these you're looking at 153 calories, about 7 grams of fat, 21.5 grams of carbohydrates, and about 5.6 grams of protein.<s>
So, I hope you like them.<s>
I hope you get creative and have a little bit of fun with it.<s>

<transcript id="13" title="Healthy Recipes- Cinnamon Swirl Protein Bread " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaRQDwuRe_w" mode="non-automatic">
[music] Hi, I'm Jamie Eason and today I'm in the BODYBUILDING.COM kitchen, excited to show you how I make my cinnamon swirl protein bread.<s>
It's one of my favorite things to eat.<s>
I can eat it at as a snack or even as a meal, because it's got your healthy carb, and your healthy protein.<s>
So, let's get started.<s>
First thing you're gonna want to do is preheat your oven to 350 degrees.<s>
The next thing I did was I got my pan ready.<s>
This is an 8-by-8 inch Pyrex dish.<s>
I just did a light little nonstick spray and you can set that aside.<s>
And then I get all my ingredients together.<s>
And for this I want a large bowl for my dry ingredients and a smaller bowl for my wet ingredients.<s>
So, the first ingredient I'm using is oat flour.<s>
In the supermarket this is what oat flour looks like.<s>
Now, I'm often asked if this is gluten-free.<s>
And oats typically are gluten-free, but one thing to note is that unless it doesn't indicate it on the bag, you're never really sure if maybe it was cross contaminated in processing.<s>
So, for this one it doesn't indicate gluten-free, but for the most part oats are, but if you're concerned, be sure to look for that indication on the label.<s>
If you can't find the oats in the supermarket, you can actually make your own.<s>
You can use a coffee grinder and just grind a little bit at a time or you could use a blender.<s>
Just make sure to know that sometimes you can't get it as finely ground as what's in the package.<s>
So, you might have to increase the amount that you're using for the recipe.<s>
In this large bowl I've added a 1 1/2 cup of the oat flour.<s>
And to that I'm gonna add a vanilla whey protein.<s>
Now, you can use whichever one you'd like.<s>
There's two scoops in here.<s>
Make sure to know, though, that the different flavors from the different manufacturers will make them taste differently.<s>
So, I like to use one that has as few ingredients in it as possible; the cleaner, the better.<s>
So, I'm gonna dump that into my oat flour.<s>
And then to that I'm gonna add my salt.<s>
Now, if you use a leavening agent like baking soda or baking powder, you usually need salt, because that makes it react.<s>
Add those in.<s>
And then to this dry ingredient batter I'm gonna actually add 1/4 cup of Stevia.<s>
This is what Stevia looks like at the supermarket.<s>
Stevia is a great natural sweetener because it's no calorie and it has no carb.<s>
But I don't typically use just Stevia alone to sweeten my recipes, because it can be kind of bitter.<s>
There's different brands of Stevia.<s>
There's Stevia and there's another brand called Truvia.<s>
Truvia's a great option too, but it's typically more expensive.<s>
There's two sides to the stevia plant.<s>
This one tends to be slightly more bitter.<s>
It is cheaper.<s>
And then the Truvia you usually see it in packets or in a little tiny tub for baking.<s>
We're going the cheap route today.<s>
So, that's it for our dry ingredients.<s>
We do have these two other ingredients.<s>
These are the extra special ones that just make it extra yummy.<s>
But we're gonna use those later, so I'm gonna keep those to the side.<s>
I'm gonna get my whisk and just mix this up really well.<s>
Make sure I get that baking powder all incorporated, because sometimes if you don't it won't bake evenly.<s>
So, I think that looks good.<s>
So, I'm gonna set that to the side and get the smaller bowl ready for my wet ingredients.<s>
For the wet ingredients we're gonna need two egg whites.<s>
You can actually use a whole egg if you want to use a whole egg.<s>
But I prefer to minimize the fat in pretty much any recipe if I can do that and my second egg.<s>
And if you ever drop the yolk in there, you can just use the same shell to fish it out.<s>
It comes right out, so.<s>
I've dropped plenty.<s>
And then to the eggs I'm gonna add one jar of baby food applesauce.<s>
Now, you can use regular applesauce, but one of the reasons I like the baby food brand is there's typically no additives, as long as you read the label.<s>
There's no additives and it's nice and portion controlled.<s>
So, I'll open that, get all the good stuff off the top, and then scoop this out.<s>
But again, just unsweetened applesauce from the jar that works just as well.<s>
That's my additional sweetener--one of them to the Stevia, which actually will cut some of that bitterness.<s>
Next thing I'm gonna add is gonna be my yogurt.<s>
And I choose Greek yogurt, because Greek yogurt actually has less sugar and it has added protein.<s>
So, I only need a half a container of this.<s>
So, I'm gonna scoop that out.<s>
That's gonna add some moisture to this bread.<s>
The baby food applesauce and the yogurt actually replace the butter and oil in a traditional recipe.<s>
So, I'll add that.<s>
And then for a substitute for milk I'm using my unsweetened Almond Breeze.<s>
Now, Almond Breeze, again, I like this better than say soy or rice milk, because it has, again, added protein.<s>
So, it's just more nutritious and it's healthy fat.<s>
So, I'll add that.<s>
I'm gonna do about a cup.<s>
And that's about it for my wet ingredients.<s>
Make sure I combine that really well.<s>
This is really a pretty simple recipe.<s>
And it tastes really, really good.<s>
It's, again, one of my favorites.<s>
You can actually make this in either the 8-by-8 like we're gonna do or you can do it in a traditional loaf pan.<s>
Now that I've mixed all the wet ingredients, I'm gonna add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients.<s>
So, I'll get my large bowl back.<s>
And I'm gonna get my little rubber spatula, so I can get all of the wet ingredients out of there.<s>
Just really scrap the bowl.<s>
The more moisture, the better, 'cause then they'll be nice and moist and stay that way.<s>
Not get dried out.<s>
So, I've added the wet to the dry and I'm gonna mix that.<s>
And let's see.<s>
And you want it to be slightly runny, because it needs to pour really easily.<s>
So, if it's too thick, you can always add a little bit more of the Almond Breeze or almond milk, whichever brand you want to choose.<s>
Alright, that looks pretty good.<s>
I'm always tempted to lick it, but I won't 'cause there's raw eggs in there.<s>
So, I'm now gonna set this to the side again because now I'm gonna start using my special dry ingredients.<s>
Here I've got my cinnamon and I've got Xylitol.<s>
Now, Xylitol is the other brand of sweetener that I like to use or the other type of sweetener, because this one, even though it's no calorie, it actually has carbs, but it is far less bitter than something like Stevia.<s>
So, I find whenever I use both it kind of balances out that bitterness.<s>
So, I'm gonna add my cinnamon to my Xylitol.<s>
This is a 1/3 of a cup.<s>
You can use more or less.<s>
I just like my cinnamon swirl protein bread pretty sweet.<s>
And I'm gonna add 2 or 3 teaspoons of cinnamon.<s>
Again, however much you like.<s>
I added 3.<s>
I really, really like cinnamon.<s>
So, I'll pour that in.<s>
You mix that up really well.<s>
Now, Xylitol does tend to be a little more granular than traditional sugar and more granular than the Stevia, but I think that's good, because it actually helps sort of maintain that layer that we're trying to create in our protein bread.<s>
And also, I don't know if you know, but Xylitol is actually the same thing that's used in fluoride toothpaste and it's actually good for your teeth.<s>
So, imagine that; a sugar that's good for your teeth.<s>
So, I think that's nice and mixed.<s>
Looks pretty good.<s>
So, now I'm gonna set these things aside.<s>
Grab my pan.<s>
Now, we'll start putting together our dessert.<s>
I'm gonna pour a really shallow layer on the bottom of the pan, kind of spread that out.<s>
The thinner, the better, because if you pour half the batter, which seems like that should be fine, typically you're gonna kind of miss that little cinnamon layer that's in between.<s>
So, I'll spread that out really well.<s>
That looks pretty good.<s>
And again, depending on your protein, the consistency of your batter might vary a little bit.<s>
So, now I'm gonna add my cinnamon Xylitol mixture--cinnamon sugar, we'll just call it that.<s>
Sounds better.<s>
And it's pretty heavy.<s>
I like to actually add more than half.<s>
So, that's covered pretty well.<s>
Got about that much left, I guess, for the top.<s>
And that's what my middle looks like.<s>
So, then I'm gonna pour the rest of the batter on top.<s>
And you just kind of want to do it where it's, you know, even.<s>
Make sure you get it all covered and... Alright, that looks pretty good.<s>
So, I'm gonna spread that out.<s>
And then I'm just gonna add the rest of the cinnamon sugar on top.<s>
The nice thing about this too is that it looks really pretty.<s>
And if you make it actually in the loaf pan, you can cut slices and actually use it to make French toast, which is pretty good as well.<s>
So, I'm gonna take my knife now and to make a swirl I'm gonna draw my knife through the batter.<s>
Can do it however you want just kind of make sure it's incorporated.<s>
I just kind of go back and forth a little bit.<s>
Now I'm gonna put it in the oven that remember I preheated before at 350 degrees.<s>
Okay.<s>
It's been 24 minutes.<s>
Let's check our cinnamon protein bread.<s>
Your oven, depending on the temperature, they kind of vary sometimes it's 24 minutes, sometimes it might be more like 30 minutes.<s>
So, let's check and see how ours looks.<s>
Okay.<s>
It looks pretty good.<s>
I think now we've got to let it cool down for about 5-10 minutes before we can actually cut it into serving sizes.<s>
Okay, now I'm gonna cut this into serving sizes.<s>
Let's see.<s>
I do about three cuts this way and then three in the opposite direction.<s>
And that should make 16 for your 8-by-8 inch pan.<s>
And about two squares really would be a serving size.<s>
For a guy you could get away with maybe three or even four if you really, really want to indulge, I guess.<s>
But two squares is gonna have, you know, just around only 100 calories and it's about 8 or so grams of protein, about 8 carbs.<s>
It just depends on the type of protein that you decide to use.<s>
So, looks pretty good.<s>
You can see the little, hopefully you can kind of see the little layer of cinnamon in there.<s>
It's a little harder to see here, 'cause my cutting skills are poor.<s>
But, let's see what it tastes like.<s>
Tastes pretty good.<s>
[giggling] You're gonna want to make sure you store these in the frigerator.<s>
There's no artificial flavors or preservatives.<s>
and also, if you want to see how I pack these to take them with me when I travel, check out the pumpkin protein bar video and for this recipe check the bottom of the page.<s>

<transcript id="14" title="Healthy Recipes- Death By Garlic Roasted Asparagus " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sngFbBW01q8" mode="non-automatic">
[music] I'm Natalie Hodson, and I'm here in the bodybuilding.com kitchen today, showing you how to make one of my favorite side dish recipes and I call it Death-by-Garlic Roasted Asparagus.<s>
And it's a really good side dish to go with chicken or tilapia and it even works great as leftovers.<s>
I put it in a Ziploc bag and use it the next day.<s>
For today's recipe, this is a pretty simple recipe though we only use a few ingredients and I have everything here.<s>
We are going to use fresh asparagus and use about 1 pound of asparagus.<s>
They usually come in bundles like this.<s>
And some asparagus is a little bit more thin and some asparagus is a little bit thicker and it doesn't really matter, you can use either.<s>
We're gonna use fresh garlic and some garlic does come pre-minced but I prefer the fresh garlic.<s>
I think it makes the recipe taste a little bit better so we're gonna just buy the garlic clove like this.<s>
And then we are going to use garlic powder and just make sure that you get the garlic powder and not the garlic salt.<s>
They look real similar.<s>
They come in the same size of container but the garlic salt has quite a bit of salt added to it and the garlic powder is just straight garlic.<s>
And then we are going to use extra virgin olive oil and we're just gonna use 1 tablespoon of this, so just a little bit.<s>
And then some pepper and I have fresh ground pepper but you could--if you don't have the fresh ground, just regular black pepper will work as well.<s>
And then we're gonna bake everything on a cookie sheet and line it with aluminum foil and I already went ahead and pre-heated my oven to 400 degrees.<s>
So the first thing we're gonna do is line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.<s>
And this just makes for easier cleanup so that way, when you're done, all you have to do is take your aluminum foil out, throw it in the trash and it's really easy to clean up.<s>
Okay.<s>
So then we're just gonna set this aside.<s>
First, we just take our bunch of asparagus, take off the rubber bands and then just rinse this, make sure that gets nice and rinsed and then what I do is I like to keep the asparagus still in the bunch formation and you want to cut off the bottom about inch of the stalk and--because the bottom of the stalk is really tough and it doesn't taste good, it's not fun to chew.<s>
So what I do is I just take a kitchen knife and I just cut it all at once so it's really fast and easy.<s>
And you just cut off the bottom of the asparagus and then what you're gonna do is evenly distribute the asparagus over the cookie sheet.<s>
The next step is mincing the garlic.<s>
So garlic, when it comes in a clove, has an outer shell kind of like an onion and so what I usually do is just cut the end off just so it's easier to peel and then there's some stuff, I just throw that away and then there's--if you can see inside, there's a lot of little what are called garlic cloves, so you just take out--this recipe calls for anywhere from four to six garlic cloves and it just depends on how much garlic you like.<s>
I usually--I like a lot of garlic so I err on the side of six but if you don't like garlic as much or as strong, then you could just do four.<s>
And another thing too, if you don't like garlic, you could actually make this recipe even without the garlic and just use salt and pepper and it would still taste pretty good.<s>
All right.<s>
So I'm just gonna set this aside and we have six garlic cloves here.<s>
Now these still have kind of an outer papery shell on them.<s>
And so you need to take that off.<s>
So what you do is you just put the garlic clove flat on your cutting board, take a knife that has kind of a wider flat edge and you just go like this and you just hit it and what it does is it kind of crushes your garlic so it makes it really easy to pull but it actually, I found out, this one has two cloves inside of it so I'm gonna do that again.<s>
And then it makes it really easy just to peel off the outer shell.<s>
So I'm just gonna do this for all six.<s>
I really like--I eat asparagus a lot.<s>
I really like eating asparagus and one thing that a lot of people don't know is that asparagus is actually really high in folate and a lot of pregnant women are recommended to take folic acid which is the supplemental form of folate and so asparagus is really good for pregnant women too.<s>
And asparagus is also a natural diuretic so if you feel like you're holding on to some water weight or if you're feeling kind of bloated, sometimes eating some asparagus can help your body rid itself of some of that water.<s>
All right.<s>
So your hands are gonna feel kind of sticky when you're doing this.<s>
That's okay, that's normal.<s>
One, two, three, four, five.<s>
All right.<s>
So since that original clove actually was two cloves inside of it, I'm gonna set one of them to the side.<s>
And then I just throw all the paper stuff away.<s>
Sometimes it sticks to your hand a little bit.<s>
I just rinse my fingers.<s>
All right.<s>
So we're gonna mince the garlic really finely and I'm just gonna do that with a knife.<s>
We already took the outer shell off, the papery part, and I just put my hand on the top and I kind of bunch it together and then I just mince it like this and I just keep pressure on the top of the knife and I just kind of keep going back and forth and then what I do is bunch it back together and just keep mincing, just like this.<s>
And you just want it really pretty finely minced because you don't want anybody to take a big old chunk of garlic.<s>
They might not appreciate you for that.<s>
So this is looking pretty good.<s>
I would say that's about as finely minced as you want.<s>
So I'm going to rinse my hands.<s>
And then I'm gonna set this aside for a second.<s>
And then what we're gonna do is put the olive oil on.<s>
So I just use 1 tablespoon of olive oil.<s>
Now this recipe makes four servings and so each serving is gonna have less than a teaspoon of olive oil.<s>
So I do--I like to measure it out because sometimes I have a tendency to use too much olive oil so I just like to measure it out that way and know I'm just using a tablespoon.<s>
And I just slowly drizzle it over.<s>
Just like this.<s>
And then what I'll do is I'll take either a spatula or even just the measuring spoon and I'll just sort of go like this just to make sure that the olive oil doesn't get wasted on the bottom of the cookie sheet and that it gets over all the asparagus.<s>
So then what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the garlic powder so if you have thicker stalks you might not need quite as much garlic powder, but if you have more stalks, you might need a little bit more, if you have thinner stalks.<s>
So I just sprinkle--this is 1 teaspoon and that didn't even cover half of it so I'm gonna do it again, 3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon.<s>
So just gonna keep sprinkling and it looks like I'm gonna use the whole tablespoon for this recipe 'cause remember this is called Death-by-Garlic Asparagus so it's gonna be pretty heavy on the garlic.<s>
And if you don't like garlic, again, you can use lighter garlic or even no garlic and just use salt and pepper.<s>
And then I'm gonna use some fresh ground pepper and this, I just kind of eyeball it.<s>
You could probably use about a teaspoon, maybe 2 teaspoons and if you don't have the fresh ground, just regular black pepper will work.<s>
And if you wanted to add some salt, you can, but I usually just don't add extra salt.<s>
And then what I'm going to do is take my knife and kind of scoop the garlic onto the knife and then just evenly distribute this over the asparagus.<s>
So I just take my finger and I just go like this.<s>
Now if you were to eat a raw garlic clove, your eyes would probably water up and your mouth would probably start to burn because it's really spicy but when you roast it like we're gonna do on 400 degrees, it kind of takes some of the spiciness out of the garlic and it makes it have more of the garlic flavor that we're used to.<s>
So that's it.<s>
All I'm gonna do is rinse my hands and then stick this in the oven at 400 degrees and I'm gonna cook it for 15 to 20 minutes.<s>
So what I'm going to do is put this in the oven, set the timer for 10 minutes.<s>
At 10 minutes, I'm gonna take a spatula and just kind of rotate the asparagus a little bit to make sure that one side doesn't get burnt or crispy and then I'm gonna put it back in the oven anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.<s>
And if it starts to look too brown, then I'll pull it out at 5 minutes.<s>
Usually I cook it for the full 20 minutes.<s>
All right.<s>
So we just took the asparagus out of the oven.<s>
At 10 minutes, we checked the asparagus, just rotate it, make sure it wasn't burning and then at 15 minutes we checked it again and what I like to look for is to make sure that the garlic starts to kind of turn brown a little bit and actually at 15 minutes ours looked good so you can cook it 15 and up to 20 minutes but we took ours out at 15 minutes.<s>
And then what I do is I just use my spatula and put the asparagus onto a plate.<s>
Just like that.<s>
And this asparagus is a little bit thinner which is probably why we were able to take it out at 15 minutes too.<s>
If your asparagus is a little bit thicker, you'll probably want to go closer towards the 20-minute mark.<s>
And this looks really good.<s>
I'm gonna clean up this super easy.<s>
All I do is fold up the aluminum foil, throw it in the trash and this looks really good so I'm gonna try it.<s>
And you can serve this warm or you can serve it chilled as well.<s>
Tastes really good.<s>

<transcript id="15" title="Healthy Recipes- Easy 10 Minute Chicken Tacos " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXSqkdBsm4o" mode="non-automatic">
[music] [music] Hi, I'm Christine Avanti, celebrity nutritionist and chef.<s>
Today I'm going to be teaching you how to make my world-famous 10-minute tacos.<s>
But before I get started, I just want to give you a rundown on what the ingredients are.<s>
So very simple, we're starting out with some grilled chicken breast, okay?<s>
I'm going to be topping my tacos with some shredded lettuce, some salsa.<s>
I'm gonna use a little bit of black beans and low-fat shredded cheese and just as a side, I've got some brown rice, okay?<s>
We also are using white corn tortillas.<s>
I love these guys.<s>
I'm gonna garnish with some fresh lime and some cilantro.<s>
Mmm, so good, I love it.<s>
And a little bit of avocado, a right?<s>
Are you guys ready?<s>
I'm hungry so I'm gonna get started.<s>
All right, so we're gonna start with a little bit of olive oil, just a teeny bit, just for some cooking, get that chicken cooked up.<s>
I've got my pan on medium high.<s>
Just gonna let that heat up for a second.<s>
Every good chef loves to season with salt and pepper, and I know people are afraid of salt but I'm not afraid of salt.<s>
I eat healthy all the time.<s>
I exercise a lot so salt is not going to kill me or my clients.<s>
If you have high blood pressure, then that's a different story.<s>
So we've got some salt in there always gonna go with the base, fresh-cracked pepper.<s>
This chicken breast--see, my husband seems to like this and guys really like this.<s>
This is pre-made, store-bought, cut up chicken breast.<s>
I'm not the hugest fan of that but if you're in a hurry, it's good just to buy chicken breast already cut up and made.<s>
You can buy it at the grocery store, Trader Joe's, wherever.<s>
So I'm gonna put my chicken in here.<s>
It's about 4 ounces of chicken breast.<s>
Okay.<s>
That's 4 ounces.<s>
Let me wash my hand really quick.<s>
I'm sorry, guys, but you can't cross contaminate.<s>
Sorry.<s>
So when you touch meat, you always want to wash your hands with hot, soapy water because cross contamination can be a problem in the kitchen.<s>
I'm gonna season.<s>
Instead of using the packet of taco seasoning that's high in sodium and preservatives, I'm gonna use some fresh spices, just a little bit of paprika, just sprinkling.<s>
You don't have to get out a measuring spoon.<s>
This is some chili powder and it's gonna start to smoke, which I love.<s>
Some cayenne pepper, some crushed red pepper and a little bit of cumin.<s>
Cumin is a spice that you will see a lot in Spanish and Latin cooking.<s>
We're smoking, whoo, hoo, hoo.<s>
Okay.<s>
Literally because this is pre-made chicken breast, I'm just gonna look it for just like a minute, just to get the spices on it.<s>
And also when you heat a spice, that lets the flavor release so kind of fun, kind of cool.<s>
Smells good.<s>
And I think that this chicken breast looks prettier with the spices on it.<s>
All right, so I'm turning off my heat.<s>
I'm moving my pan over.<s>
Let that cool off.<s>
The spices are making me cough.<s>
I'm sorry.<s>
It's how it happens.<s>
Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get my tortillas ready.<s>
Now if you have a gas range at home, you just turn on your heat, kind of to low, throw the tortilla right over it.<s>
You don't spray, you don't do anything.<s>
Just put the tortilla right over it.<s>
If you don't have a gas stove at home and you have an electric stove, that little like coil-looking thing, heating element, as they call it, you can put it on that too, medium high, just make sure that it's clean and it's not like coated with like sticky like Cream of Wheat from yesterday or something.<s>
And you just leave it on there and then I hope every healthy cook at home as a set of tongs because if you don't, you need to go by some.<s>
They're like a dollar at Target, okay?<s>
Go get yourself some tongs because you're gonna use those to flip over your tortillas.<s>
You use them for a lot of things, but for this meal, it's for tortillas.<s>
Just get some fire on the--look at how pretty that is.<s>
Just like a Martha Stewart photo at the end of the day when I'm done with these.<s>
We'll make them so pretty that Martha will be proud.<s>
Okay, they're almost done.<s>
And you know what?<s>
If you don't have--if you don't feel like heating them on your heating element, on your stove, on your gas range, you can always just microwave them.<s>
I'm not a big fan of the microwave but last case scenario--worst case scenario, go ahead and throw them on there.<s>
This one looks like it's literally on fire, which is fine.<s>
Okay, so I'm turning all the burners off.<s>
And I'm going to very quickly cut up my avocado 'cause that's gonna go into my taco.<s>
And I just want to cut a lime 'cause we want a little bit of lime juice once we're ready to build the taco here.<s>
And then I'm just gonna cut a tiny bit of cilantro.<s>
Chop it up real quick so we've got that.<s>
Now, these tacos, it's not super hot.<s>
I can hold it with my hand.<s>
It's no big deal.<s>
I'm gonna take my chicken--look at this chicken.<s>
It's gorgeous, a lot better-looking than that chicken I had before, right?<s>
Put it in there.<s>
Okay, it's a little hot.<s>
Ow.<s>
Okay, cool off, cool off, cool off.<s>
I'm gonna put a little bit of--I'll put some rice in here.<s>
I'm put some black beans.<s>
It's kind of hot.<s>
Hold on, you guys.<s>
Wow.<s>
I think I might have grabbed it too soon.<s>
Okay, so mental note, don't grab the tortillas straight off of the stove, give it a second to cool off.<s>
I mean I'm not completely burning to where I need to go to the emergency room but I'm burnt.<s>
It hurts.<s>
Okay, so there I'm gonna put a little bit of fresh lettuce.<s>
I'm gonna put a little bit of fresh cheese.<s>
How pretty is that?<s>
There's one taco.<s>
I wasn't lying when I said 10 minutes, kids.<s>
Ten minutes.<s>
Okay, put this bad boy on here.<s>
More of my--hey, Mr. Avocado, I know you wanted to go for a ride, but I'll use you in a minute.<s>
Okay, more chicken.<s>
Again, look at this chicken compared to straight from the store, okay?<s>
We got some quick here.<s>
We kicked it up a notch.<s>
Thanks, Emeril.<s>
Okay, and I just touched chicken.<s>
All right, sorry.<s>
Washing my hands.<s>
Okay, a little bit of rice, a little bit of black beans.<s>
It's not a ton, but, you know, it's enough.<s>
Some people like their cheese right up against the warm parts.<s>
We can do it this one like that, put the cheese right there, a little bit of lettuce, some avocado slices.<s>
And I've got some salsa as well so we can put some salsa on there when we're done.<s>
Give it a little bit of cilantro, little squeeze of lime.<s>
Simple.<s>
We'll make our last taco.<s>
This tortilla was really hot so I was giving it a few minutes to cool off.<s>
I think we're there.<s>
It feels good to me.<s>
Last little bit of chicken.<s>
If you guys don't have spices at your house, like cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika, chili powder, you should go get some because it really makes food taste good, okay?<s>
It makes food taste phenomenal and I think that we--not only do we like good-tasting food but, as humans, we eat with our eyes so we want the food to look pretty as well.<s>
And just because it's healthy, does not mean it has to look bland and not fun, okay?<s>
Little bit of cilantro.<s>
I'll do my lime again, yummy, yummy, yummy.<s>
Who wouldn't want to eat these?<s>
That's what I want to know.<s>
I'm gonna eat them.<s>
So we've got three tacos, little tacos.<s>
I mean these tortillas were pretty small.<s>
They weren't that big.<s>
You get a little bit of extra brown rice on the side for a little bit more carb.<s>
These tacos are only about 10 to 12 grams of carbohydrate per tortilla, so that's why we're adding a little bit more black beans and brown rice to it.<s>
You can put your salsa there on the plate for just prettiness.<s>
And did we already give it lime?<s>
I'm gonna give it a little bit more lime.<s>
We love lime.<s>
Lime definitely helps the flavor and we're gonna put some more avocado.<s>
Here's the great thing about this meal, avocado is loaded with what we call mono and saturated fatty acids.<s>
These mono and saturated fatty acids are good fats.<s>
They've been clinically shown in several studies, one particular a Yale study, that actually helped reduce belly fat by 33% in people who were dieting.<s>
Another study showed that mono and saturated fatty acids that come from avocado, our dear friend the avocado right there, were actually people who were eating the more of these good fats from avocado were losing more weight than other dieters that were eating the same amount of calories.<s>
So it's not only about calories in versus calories out.<s>
It's about what are your calories?<s>
Are you eating good fats?<s>
Are you eating lean proteins?<s>
Are you eating processed food?<s>
If you're gonna eat a processed meal that's 400 calories versus a meal made of real food that's 400 calories.<s>
Trust me, the real food meal is gonna help your body get filter and leaner faster than anything else.<s>
So I'm putting all my avocado on here.<s>
Put a little bit on our rice.<s>
Who says you can't have avocado on rice, right?<s>
Little bit more black beans.<s>
I like to mix up my black beans with my rice.<s>
I just think it's more exciting and more fun.<s>
And here you go.<s>
You've got my 10-minute tacos, 377 calories for this entire plate, 20 grams of protein, 50 grams of carbs.<s>
You're good to go.<s>
All right, I'm Christine Avanti.<s>

<transcript id="16" title="Healthy Recipes- Frozen Spinach Cups " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDz0uGSB_4k" mode="non-automatic">
I'm Natalie Hodson here in the bodybuilding.com kitchen showing you how to make Frozen Spinach Cups.<s>
This is a really easy--more of a tip than a recipe.<s>
I use this to thicken up my protein shakes, and it's great because when you put it in a protein shake, you really can't even taste it.<s>
Now it does turn your protein shakes green so if you have an issue with the color of your protein shake then you can add a few blueberries to it and it turns it purple and then you don't see the green color.<s>
Spinach is a green, dark green leafy vegetable which is really good.<s>
It's high in vitamin A and it is really high in iron and calcium as well.<s>
So for the ingredients we're gonna use today, we're gonna use spinach and usually I buy between a 6 to an 8 ounce bag.<s>
Different brands have different sizes that they sell but just one bag of spinach.<s>
And then water.<s>
And here I have 2 cups of water.<s>
And we might not use the full 2 cups.<s>
What we're gonna do is add the spinach and slowly add the water until it's the consistency that we need.<s>
And then you're gonna need a blender, and then we're gonna use a muffin tin pan as well.<s>
And what we're gonna do is once we blend everything together, we're gonna pour the liquid into the muffin tin pan and then freeze it that way.<s>
Okay, so this recipe is really simple.<s>
All you do is you put your spinach in the blender.<s>
And I just take handfuls and put it in.<s>
And you're gonna start by filling it about almost all the way full.<s>
My rule of thumb is about 1/2 cup of water per 2 handfuls of spinach so I just kinda pour the water in.<s>
There it looks like we used about 1 cup so we'll start with that and then slowly add water as we need to.<s>
And then you just put the lid on your blender.<s>
It's gonna be kinda loud.<s>
Alright.<s>
So as you can see, it really blends down quite a bit, and so what I'm gonna do is actually add some more spinach.<s>
And so we're gonna add the rest of our spinach in here.<s>
And then we're just gonna keep blending it.<s>
I don't think I need to add more water, but I'm just gonna kinda blend it.<s>
If it gets too thick--you basically want it just like a liquid consistency, maybe a little bit thicker.<s>
Not quite as thick as a milkshake consistency.<s>
Alright.<s>
I think this looks pretty good.<s>
Basically you just want it ground fine enough so you don't have big chunks of spinach.<s>
And then what I do is I take this, and I just pour it right into my muffin tin.<s>
And I usually fill these pretty much all the way full because what I do is, and I'll show you later, is I just use one in each of my protein shakes.<s>
Alright.<s>
So it looks like this made about six.<s>
And so we could double this if we wanted and make 12 and freeze all 12, but today I think we're just gonna make all 6.<s>
I'm gonna stick this in the freezer and then just let it freeze for about 3 hours.<s>
You can even leave it in there for longer if you aren't home after 3 hours.<s>
And then we're gonna pop these out and put them in Ziploc baggies to keep them in the freezer to use for our protein shakes later in the week.<s>
So I just took these spinach cups out of the freezer.<s>
They've been in the freezer for about 3 hours, and as you can tell, they're rock solid so you can do one of two things.<s>
You can just let them sit on the counter for a few minutes until they're melted a little bit and you can pop them out or what I like to do--it's a little bit faster--is I'm just gonna run the bottom of the pan underneath some hot water.<s>
Alright.<s>
That should do the trick.<s>
And then what I like to do is just take a butter knife.<s>
And obviously we're not gonna use all six of these spinach cups in a protein shake at once, and so I just take Ziploc bags and I put usually three or four of the spinach cups in a Ziploc bag and I put them in the freezer.<s>
So that way later when I go to make a protein shake, I can just grab one out.<s>
I also use these when I make smoothies, fruit smoothies for my 2-year old.<s>
It's one of the few ways I can get him to eat vegetables.<s>
So I'm just gonna pop the spinach cup out.<s>
That's what it looks like.<s>
And just gonna go ahead--it's a little bit messy, but you can just rinse your hands when you're done.<s>
So I'll probably do three in a bag.<s>
Sometimes I try to fit too many in there and I can't get it to zip.<s>
Oops.<s>
I'm gonna just put two in this bag and we're gonna save one to use in a protein shake today.<s>
To make the protein shake, I like to use unsweetened almond milk.<s>
I like to use the kind with vanilla.<s>
Just make sure you get the one that has 35 or 40 calories, and read the ingredient list because some of the almond milks do add sugar, and you wanna make sure it's the unsweetened kind without any sugar.<s>
But if you don't have almond milk, you could also use water or regular milk.<s>
I usually use about 8 ounces or so.<s>
I just kind of eyeball it.<s>
And then I'm gonna do one scoop of whey protein.<s>
You can use these spinach cups with any flavor, any brand.<s>
And then instead of ice, I'm gonna use my frozen spinach cup.<s>
And then what it's gonna do is it's gonna thicken up the shake and also add some good vitamins: vitamin A, calcium, and iron.<s>
Just gonna blend it up.<s>
Alright.<s>
That looks pretty good.<s>
And then I'm just gonna pour it into my cup.<s>
So it does turn the shake a green color, and if that kinda weirds you out, you can add some blueberries to this and then it turns it purple.<s>
And actually my son won't drink them if they're green, but if I add some blueberries and it turns them purple, then he has no clue and he drinks them just fine so--tastes like a protein shake.<s>
You can't even taste the spinach at all.<s>

<transcript id="17" title="Healthy Recipes- Grilled Thai Beef Salad - Bodybuilding.com " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z2gj2cvrMk" mode="non-automatic">
Hi guys, Jillian Beck here.<s>
Welcome to my kitchen.<s>
Today I will be showing you my Thai beef salad.<s>
It takes about, probably 20 minute to assemble.<s>
It's super easy.<s>
It's great for summer.<s>
It's getting warmer out and I kind of tend to go with salads around this time of year, grilled proteins are excellent, the fresher, the better.<s>
So this Thai salad is amazing because it's got tons of herbs, a lot of favors, some grilled steak, which is always a winner in my book, and then a lot of great flavors that are very typical of Thai dishes.<s>
As you may know, I do like Asian food and flavors if you've followed any of my other recipes.<s>
I just think it's a really good way to add flavor without adding a ton of calories and fat and all that other junk that comes with like a lot of sauces and condiments that some other recipes call for.<s>
So I've kind of pre-made things here so it goes by a little quicker for you guys.<s>
I'll kind of show you what you're going to need for this recipe.<s>
First and foremost, you need a lean steak.<s>
I typically go with sirloin.<s>
I'll trim the fat away from it or I'll go with a flank steak.<s>
So we've grilled that on the Foreman here.<s>
If you have an outdoor grill, by all means use that.<s>
In my apartment, we don't have a grill yet so I either go to my friends house to, you know, grill on the barbecue or use the Foreman.<s>
So I've gone ahead and I've grilled it to my liking, which is about medium rare.<s>
So grill it to the temperature that you prefer.<s>
And I've sliced it so about 4 ounces sliced for one salad.<s>
We've got our mixed greens here, some mixed red lettuces and green lettuces and then we have our fresh herbs.<s>
We've got basil, mint, green onion and cilantro.<s>
So those are the components of the salad and I'm gonna show you how to make the dressing and then we'll put it all together.<s>
So for the dressing what you're going to need is fresh lime juice, which I've already gone ahead and squeezed.<s>
So we have 2 tablespoons of fresh lime.<s>
We're going to add 1 teaspoon of low-sodium soy sauce.<s>
So I'll go ahead and add that right now.<s>
Here we go.<s>
And then we're going to use fish sauce and it's just a typical Asian flavor.<s>
You can find it in the Asian market in most of your grocery stores and if you can't, maybe go to like your local Asian market to find it, but it's a pretty strong flavor but it's good.<s>
It's just a little goes a long ways.<s>
So we're gonna put 2--yeah, 2 teaspoons in here along with the 1 teaspoon of soy and then the lime juice.<s>
And then we're gonna go ahead and add lemongrass.<s>
Now you can get fresh lemongrass from the produce aisle and slice it and add it to the salad along with all the other herbs.<s>
My grocer didn't have that so I went ahead and got the lemongrass paste.<s>
So I'll go ahead and add that as well and we'll just do about half a teaspoon, just a really small squeeze of that.<s>
And usually with Asian dressings and what not, they--you need to add like a little bit of sugar or honey or agave for like the sweetness to round all the flavors out.<s>
Typically I have been using Stevia in the raw so that's what I'm gonna use here today but feel free to use whatever sweetener you choose, if that's honey, if that's agave, brown sugar, whatever it is that you want, go ahead and add that to the dressing.<s>
For me, I like I said, I just need it a tad bit sweet and so I've been using Stevia in the raw.<s>
So I'll just do like half a teaspoon of that as well.<s>
And then I'm gonna mix all those ingredients up for our dressing and let the lemongrass dissolve a little bit.<s>
And I'm also gonna add the green onions to the dressing as well to kind of soak up the flavors of that.<s>
It smells really good, really fresh.<s>
Okay, so we'll go ahead and start to plate.<s>
We'll just put the sliced steak on top of the salad here.<s>
Just lay it on there.<s>
And you can actually garnish it with all these fresh herbs before you put the steak, but I kind of messed that one up but it doesn't really matter 'cause you're gonna mix it all together anyways.<s>
So I'll put the mint and the basil and you've got your steak there.<s>
And we'll go ahead and top it with the dressing.<s>
Pour it all over.<s>
And if you want a little more spice, feel free to add like some red chili flakes would be really good.<s>
Chili paste would be good if you wanted to add that as well.<s>
And then we're gonna garnish it with a little bit of cilantro on top.<s>
So there you have it.<s>
Really simple, really fresh and easy but a ton of flavor.<s>
And there you have it, my Thai beef steak salad.<s>
There you go.<s>
I hope you guys enjoy.<s>
Thank you so much.<s>

<transcript id="18" title="Healthy Recipes- Honey Almond Protein Crisps - Bars " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gMPVegmz8E" mode="non-automatic">
[music] Hi, I'm Jamie Eason, and I'm in the bodybuilding.com kitchen today, and I'm excited 'cause I'm gonna show you how to make my Honey Almond Protein Crisps.<s>
I've showed you guys how to make chocolate protein bars, lemon protein bars, carrot cake.<s>
They're all kind of, like, cakey, so I wanted something with a little bit of crunch, and this is super, super simple and tastes really, really good.<s>
So let's get started.<s>
For this recipe we're gonna need 3 cups of crispy brown rice.<s>
We're gonna need 1 cup of whole oats.<s>
We're gonna also need a scoop of vanilla protein, whichever kind you like.<s>
We'll also need a fourth of a cup of chopped almonds.<s>
You can either just use whole almonds and break 'em up yourself, or you can buy the chopped almonds at the store.<s>
And then for our wet ingredients, we're gonna do almond butter.<s>
We're gonna have honey, and this isn't actually wet, but it's gonna go in the wet ingredients.<s>
That's our xylitol brown sugar blend.<s>
This recipe is super easy, and it comes together really, really quickly.<s>
All you're gonna need is basically a large bowl so you can dump all the ingredients in, and we need a smaller bowl so that we can actually just microwave to heat it up just a little bit, so that it's easier to actually mix into our dry ingredients.<s>
And once you do that, it's pretty much done, and we stick it in the freezer.<s>
No baking at all, and you can eat it in about 30 minutes.<s>
To begin with, we've added already 3 cups of the crispy brown rice.<s>
Now, you can hopefully find this at one of your local grocery stores.<s>
I've seen it at Whole Foods almost every time.<s>
The reason I like this, it's gluten free.<s>
It's really got very few ingredients.<s>
It does have some natural sugar in it, but it's from evaporated cane juice and it's organic molasses.<s>
So it's only got 2 grams of sugar per serving, which is 3/4ths of a cup, and we've got 3 cups in here, so you're looking at less than 5 grams of sugar for the entire batch, and you're not supposed to eat the entire batch.<s>
So 3 cups go in the bowl, and then we've got 1 cup of whole oats...<s>
So we're gonna dump that on top.<s>
And then we're gonna add a fourth of a scoop of crushed almonds.<s>
So you can actually do your own if you'd like and just use your trusty rolling pin and, you know, beat 'em down that way.<s>
Or you can buy 'em already chopped at the store, which is what we have...<s>
So I'm gonna add a fourth of a cup.<s>
And I kind of sprinkle it around, because we don't want to actually mix it up too much until we have the rest of our ingredients ready.<s>
And the last ingredient for our dry ingredients is one scoop of protein...<s>
So I'm putting that in.<s>
And a lot of you guys always ask me, "What kind of protein do I use?<s>
" Whatever kind of protein you like.<s>
I just like something that's got a good vanilla flavor 'cause it's usually a good base for everything.<s>
And I always look for the fewer ingredients, the better, but whichever one you like.<s>
Some people like it with added aminos, and all kinds of extra little things so that they can get, you know, added nutrition in one little easy scoop, so all right.<s>
I'm just gonna give it a gentle shake.<s>
Don't mix it up yet, because it'll all settle to the bottom.<s>
Set that aside.<s>
And now I'm gonna start with my wet ingredients.<s>
So we are gonna start with almond butter.<s>
Now, when you buy this stuff at the store, make sure that you're getting the one that is just almonds and salt, or just almonds.<s>
Don't get anything that has, like, added oils.<s>
As you can see, there's a ton of oil already on top.<s>
I like to pour off just a little bit.<s>
Don't pour it all off, though, because you'll have a really hard time mixing it up all the way to the bottom.<s>
So I'm gonna mix it up just a little bit... and once I get that going, we are gonna need three-fourths of a cup of this.<s>
So I like to use my one-fourth scoop.<s>
I feel like it's a little bit more manageable, so I'll just pour that in... and we'll do that three times.<s>
So I'll get that going.<s>
I have my little rubber spatula to get it out...<s>
I need three.<s>
And now you can--one of the best parts of this recipe is that it's really whatever you want to put in it, so if you wanted to use, you know, peanut butter or tahini, which is crushed sesame seeds, or any kind of nut butters that you like, really.<s>
You can use anything, and that goes for the nuts that you choose as well.<s>
You can choose whatever you wanted.<s>
So one more.<s>
And as you can see, this is a lot of healthy fats.<s>
You're forewarned at this point that this is not something you need every single day, but it's a great snack.<s>
And we have actually an event tomorrow where we'll be running and burning a lot of calories, so this would be great for that, because it's great for energy.<s>
All right.<s>
And it's being a little stubborn, but I think we got it all.<s>
Okay.<s>
So that goes in.<s>
So we've got our three-fourths of a cup.<s>
And then we're gonna need 2 cups of honey.<s>
And honey, of course, will still spike your blood sugar, but honey is so good for you.<s>
It's loaded with antioxidants.<s>
There's all sorts of benefits to it...so we're gonna add that in.<s>
Again, this isn't for everyday consumption, but it's gonna be an awesome treat.<s>
It tastes unbelievable, actually, for so few ingredients.<s>
So we'll get that in, and one more...<s>
There we go.<s>
And actually, honey is kind of fun, too, because at the store, you'll find, like, all different kinds of varieties.<s>
You might find one that's, like, lavender flavored.<s>
I got one that was rose flavored once.<s>
Not so much.<s>
I really felt like I was chewing on the lawn or something.<s>
Not good, so all right.<s>
We got that.<s>
And then to this, I'm gonna add a half a cup of xylitol brown sugar blend.<s>
You don't have to use this if you don't want to, because you're fine with that amount of honey.<s>
This will kind of kick up the intensity a little bit and make it a little sweeter.<s>
I think it really adds a lot to it.<s>
And it does add some calories, but unlike sugar, which is like 3.7 or something like that for sugar, this is only 2-point-something.<s>
So it's less, and actually, it's approved for diabetics, because it spikes your blood sugar less.<s>
So we're gonna throw that in there...but I do want to show you this one other alternative.<s>
Some of you may or may not be familiar with sucanat.<s>
It's actually a brown sugar substitute as well.<s>
If you taste it, it's really granular, but it does have a little bit of a hint of a molasses flavor added to it without extra sugar or anything.<s>
So this is definitely an option for you.<s>
So once we've put this in the bowl, I'm gonna put it in the microwave... [beeping sound] And we're just gonna do 30-second intervals is all we need.<s>
And I'm gonna move this back over here, 'cause we're gonna need it to start mixing this together.<s>
[beeping sound] Sometimes it just takes one.<s>
Sometimes it takes a little longer.<s>
I'm gonna actually go to the bigger spatula now.<s>
Actually, that heated it up pretty well...<s>
Mix it all together... and you really, you're just heating it just enough just so that it'll spread easily inside here.<s>
I think that's actually pretty good.<s>
If you needed to, you could do another 30 seconds in the microwave.<s>
So I'm gonna go ahead and pour that in.<s>
You want to kind of spread it out a little bit and get all of it out.<s>
It's gonna seem like there's really not enough to kind of go around at first, but you just kind of have to really work it in.<s>
So now I can start working it together.<s>
I like to kind of use this little fold-over technique... so it doesn't stick to my spatula...All right.<s>
So then you kind of start chopping into it.<s>
Now, you could actually add dried fruits if you wanted to, if this was for your kids.<s>
You know, I know a lot of us stay away from dried fruits, but you could do all kinds of nuts, actually.<s>
Walnuts.<s>
You could do peanuts, whatever you'd like.<s>
All right.<s>
I think we're looking pretty good.<s>
I see a few dry spots, but I think I can fix that when it put it into the bowl.<s>
So I want to use a 9 x 13 Pyrex dish.<s>
You can use whichever dish you'd like.<s>
I just find that works well because I don't need to spray it or anything.<s>
There's enough healthy fats in here that you don't have to add any nonstick sprays or anything like that.<s>
All right.<s>
I'm gonna grab my dish and pour this in... All right.<s>
And you kind of get it started--I'll move that so you can see.<s>
Kind of get it started with your spatula... and then I like to finish it with my fingers.<s>
I think it's easier to really get it pushed down in there.<s>
So wet your fingers just a little bit...so it doesn't stick, and just start really pushing it down...<s>
I could put the towel down underneath this.<s>
It wouldn't be so noisy.<s>
So I'm just really pushing it in good...and that's it.<s>
And just so you know, one of my favorite things, actually, is you can use the same technique and actually use cookie cutters, which is kind of fun, and make like little shapes and stuff for the kids.<s>
And now I'm just gonna put this in the freezer and then in about an hour to check on it... All right.<s>
It's been about an hour, so I'm gonna go ahead and get the Honey Almond Protein Crisps out of the freezer.<s>
All right.<s>
It is definitely cold.<s>
It's pretty hard.<s>
So you can either at this point cut it into squares and sometimes, I don't even like to go to all that trouble, so I just break pieces off.<s>
I recommend you store it actually in the freezer, because it'll keep the texture nice and hard, and it doesn't get too hard to bite into.<s>
But if you cut it into 18 squares, each one is about 154 calories, about 8 grams, all of good fat, 21 grams of carbs, and about 4 grams of protein.<s>
So I guarantee you will like this.<s>
It's really good stuff, and I hope you will come back next time whenever I'm making something new.<s>

<transcript id="19" title="Healthy Recipes- Italian Turkey Burgers " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5Sm-79QRCw" mode="non-automatic">
Hi.<s>
I'm Jamie Eason, and today I'm in the bodybuilding.com kitchen, and I'm gonna make my Italian Turkey Zucchini Burgers.<s>
I've already started by prepping my oven and setting it on broil.<s>
You wanna set it on high.<s>
There's high and low settings.<s>
Make sure you put it on high, and I've moved the rack to the top about 2 inches from the heating element.<s>
I've also already grated my zucchini.<s>
I'm using 2 pounds of turkey and for every pound of turkey, I've grated 2 zucchinis.<s>
So we've got quite a bit of zucchini here, and it makes a lot of juice but we want that because turkey tends to be really dry so that's why we're putting the zucchini in there in the first place so it'll add some moisture.<s>
So I want all of the liquid--as much as I can get.<s>
Try to balance that and get it in the bowl.<s>
Alright.<s>
And then after I've added the zucchini, I'm gonna add all of my spices.<s>
This is a really easy, easy recipe.<s>
It's got 1 measuring spoon which is a teaspoon.<s>
So I've got a teaspoon of pepper here, 1 teaspoon of garlic, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of oregano, and then 2 teaspoons of onion powder and 2 teaspoons of basil.<s>
So that's it.<s>
It's lots of green stuff.<s>
And then I'm gonna add the turkey.<s>
Then this is where you get your hands dirty.<s>
You just reach in and stir, mushing is out.<s>
You never wanna over-work protein because then it can tend to get a little bit tough so just really kinda squish and pick it up and fold it over until you get it all incorporated.<s>
You can make this same recipe with really any sort of meat whether it's beef or maybe ground chicken breast.<s>
I actually prefer lean ground chicken breast but it's actually--it's really hard to find.<s>
Not every butcher makes it or every grocery store offers it.<s>
It's looking pretty good.<s>
Now I've already prepped my pan.<s>
I covered it in foil because this can get pretty messy.<s>
The zucchini adds a lot of liquid so sometimes it gets a little runny.<s>
You can make these on the grill if you prefer, but for me the broiler is just easy cleanup.<s>
That's why I like it.<s>
Now I just need to form these into patties.<s>
I get about a palm full, and you wanna aim for maybe about 4 or 5 ounces.<s>
This whole recipe makes about nine to ten burgers.<s>
This is actually a really great low carb option.<s>
Zucchinis are a carb, but there's very few carbs in them.<s>
This recipe's also really versatile.<s>
Instead of burgers, you could make them into meatballs and put them on spaghetti squash and there's another low carb option.<s>
For me, spaghetti squash is a lifesaver whenever I'm sort of in that low carb phase.<s>
And something like this makes me think that--or makes me feel like I'm having spaghetti.<s>
Also, using the grater to grate up your vegetables and things like that, not only does it add moisture to your lean meats, but it adds more volume so even though it seems like maybe your--like for instance, if you're having a party or something and you've gotta make your dollar stretch, you can add lots of grated vegetables to things and it'll actually create more food.<s>
So the more zucchini I were to grate up, if I only had 2 pounds of turkey, it actually might make more patties.<s>
So it looks like I'm done.<s>
I'm gonna rinse my hands off.<s>
Okay.<s>
Now I've just gotta get them in the oven.<s>
With the broiler, you're actually gonna treat it just like a grill, and this one-- I usually like to do about 7 or 8 minutes on each side depending on how hot your oven is.<s>
I'm gonna set mine for 7 minutes and then we'll open it, flip 'em over, and do 7 minutes more.<s>
Okay.<s>
We've flipped the burgers, and it's been 7 minutes on one side and now 7 minutes on the other.<s>
Let's get 'em out.<s>
They look good.<s>
So you always wanna make sure it's done so we'll just kinda poke into one and peak.<s>
No pink inside.<s>
They're really juicy so that's a good sign.<s>
And then I guess we'll just put one together.<s>
You can eat them by themselves if you're doing the low carb thing or another option is to use Ezekiel buns or any kind of bread you really want, but I prefer these.<s>
They are only made from sprouted grains so if you look at the ingredients, there's nothing artificial in them.<s>
You can only find them in the freezer section.<s>
These are buns.<s>
These are an English muffin which is another option.<s>
And then you've also got just the bread so different ones have different calorie counts.<s>
I think I'm gonna go for an English muffin.<s>
You can toast it.<s>
You can leave them soft.<s>
Whatever you'd like.<s>
I'm gonna leave mine soft.<s>
So then I've got my bun ready.<s>
I'm gonna slice up a tomato.<s>
Done a few slices, a little bit of lettuce, and then whatever condiments you wanna put on this.<s>
Ketchup works or mustard might work.<s>
I like the ketchup.<s>
This is the reduced sugar variety.<s>
Just make sure you get one that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup in it.<s>
So I'm gonna squeeze some of that one there.<s>
I like quite a bit.<s>
Get a patty.<s>
Put that on there, and then there's my burger.<s>
It looks pretty good.<s>
Alright.<s>
I'm gonna take a bite.<s>
See if I can get my mouth on it.<s>
It tastes good.<s>
Alright.<s>

<transcript id="20" title="Healthy Recipes- Pumpkin Protein Bars " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfLDYuVmb84" mode="non-automatic">
Hi.<s>
I'm Jamie Eason.<s>
Welcome to the bodybuilding.com kitchen.<s>
Today I'm gonna make my Pumpkin Protein Bars.<s>
I know I've been making a whole lot of different types of protein bars, but I don't want you to get burned out so I've got this brand new one.<s>
This one actually makes a larger portion than the 8x8 we've been using so we're gonna get a bigger Pyrex dish this time.<s>
I've prepped this by spraying non-stick spray.<s>
It's a 9x13, and I've also preheated the oven to 350 degrees.<s>
So this one's easy because it's all in one large bowl.<s>
See, first we've got 2 cups of oat flour.<s>
Again, oat flour is just ground up oatmeal, and you can buy it at the store in the healthy section.<s>
You can make your own by grinding it in a coffee grinder or in a blender.<s>
So I'm just gonna put that in.<s>
Two cups.<s>
And then I've got 2 scoops of a vanilla whey protein.<s>
You can use any flavor that you like.<s>
For me, I just look for the fewer ingredients the better 'cause then it's healthier and usually it tastes a little better too.<s>
So 2 scoops of that.<s>
And then I'm gonna start putting in all of the flavoring ingredients.<s>
I've got 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves.<s>
Cloves are pretty strong, but I think that's really what gives this its flavor.<s>
So then we've got a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of baking powder and then 1/2 teaspoon of salt.<s>
For my sweetener, I'm actually adding 1/2 cup of Xylitol.<s>
You can use the brown sugar blend.<s>
You can use the regular.<s>
I actually like the brown sugar blend for this recipe a lot, but you can't always find it.<s>
This one is just the regular half cup of Xylitol so put that in.<s>
I'm gonna mix up these dry ingredients really well.<s>
Okay.<s>
And then to this I'm gonna start adding the wet ingredients.<s>
You can mix these in separate bowls if you like, but it's really not necessary so I'm just gonna put it all right in the same bowl.<s>
First thing, I'm gonna start with four egg whites.<s>
You can use the liquid egg whites if you like.<s>
I used regular, real eggs.<s>
I kinda like those better for baking, but it's up to you.<s>
Then I'm gonna add 1/2 cup of almond milk.<s>
You can use whatever kind you want.<s>
You can do regular milk.<s>
You can do rice milk.<s>
Whatever you'd like, but I like the almond milk so 1/2 cup of that.<s>
And then to that I'm gonna add one 4 ounce of the baby food applesauce.<s>
You can use regular unsweetened applesauce at home if you have that.<s>
Put that in there.<s>
It comes out to probably about 1/4 cup if you're gonna us the jar at home.<s>
To that I'm gonna add my pumpkin.<s>
I've used a whole 15 ounce can of pumpkin for this so you can use as little or as much as you want.<s>
I really like mine really pumpkiny so I use the whole entire can.<s>
Make sure, too, that you pick the raw pumpkin and not the pumpkin pie mix that's loaded with sugar.<s>
So put that in.<s>
Then my final wet ingredient is just 2 teaspoons of vanilla.<s>
So I've got all of those in.<s>
You can use the whisk if you like, but I don't wanna make a mess so I'm just gonna fold it all in with my spatula.<s>
Okay.<s>
Starting to come together.<s>
And for this recipe, you can use nuts or you can do it without nuts.<s>
I'm gonna put some walnuts in it.<s>
I really like pumpkin and walnut together.<s>
So I've got it all mixed up.<s>
I've already put 1/2 cup of walnuts in a little baggie.<s>
So the reason I've done this is because I didn't buy the crushed up kind.<s>
I'm gonna actually crush these myself.<s>
So I like to buy the ones from the bin.<s>
Usually they're a little bit more fresh than the ones that have been sitting on the shelf for a while.<s>
So I just put them in a bag.<s>
You can grab anything you like.<s>
I like my little rolling pin.<s>
Just sort of crush them a little bit.<s>
If you're worried about adding too much fat to your dessert, you actually don't have to mix them in.<s>
You can put it all together and just maybe sprinkle half on one side or just lightly sprinkle them on top.<s>
I like to mix mine in because I like there to be nuts in every bite, but it's totally up to you.<s>
That's pretty good.<s>
Getting there.<s>
Maybe a little smaller.<s>
Alright.<s>
Now I'll just dump these in.<s>
Now the difference though--if you make it with or without nuts--with nuts, you're looking at probably about 67, 68 calories.<s>
Without nuts, you're looking at under 50.<s>
It's about 47 calories.<s>
So it's totally up to you, but the fat isn't that different and the amount of protein really isn't that different.<s>
It's like about 4 grams of protein a bar.<s>
This makes 24 bars, by the way.<s>
So I've got that all mixed in.<s>
And I'm gonna get my dish ready and just pour it in the pan.<s>
Okay.<s>
I'll get it all spread out.<s>
Now this one you wanna bake it for about 30 minutes I would say, but it's totally up to you.<s>
Some people like the bars a little bit more soft, and some people like them a little more cooked through.<s>
I suggest that if you're traveling with these, definitely keep them in the oven a little bit longer 'cause you want them to hold up.<s>
Put these in the oven.<s>
Bake it for about 30 minutes.<s>
Think that's right.<s>
And then we'll check it in about 30 minutes.<s>
Always make sure when you're baking that your oven rack is like usually in the middle.<s>
If it's too close to the heating element on the bottom, it'll burn.<s>
And if it's too high up, it'll take forever to cook so we will check on it in about 30 minutes.<s>
Alright.<s>
The timer went off.<s>
Let's check our bars.<s>
Alright.<s>
They look good.<s>
I'm pretty sure these are done, but if you wanna make sure you can stick a toothpick in it.<s>
If it comes out dry with no wetness or anything, it's pretty much ready.<s>
So I'm gonna let these cool and then we'll come back, cut them, and I'll show you how to wrap them up.<s>
Okay.<s>
Our Pumpkin Protein Bars are fully cooled so I'm gonna cut them up.<s>
Let's see.<s>
We've got--it's gonna make 24 squares so I'm gonna make 3 cuts lengthwise and 5 this way.<s>
Alright.<s>
Scoop a few of these out.<s>
They look really good.<s>
You can see some of the nuts in there.<s>
And then I'm gonna wrap up the rest.<s>
Show you how I wrap them when I travel.<s>
Be sure to store these in a cool place like the frigerator because if you leave them just out on the counter or not in your cooler, they'll actually spoil.<s>
There's no preservatives or anything in these.<s>
I do them by twos.<s>
I just place two on the saran wrap, fold over the one end, and roll it over, and then fold in the edges and--it's pretty simple.<s>
Okay.<s>
I'm gonna finish up wrapping up the rest of these.<s>

<transcript id="21" title="Healthy Recipes- Quick & Easy Turkey Meatloaf Muffins " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSSZB3jSL4M" mode="non-automatic">
[music] Hi I'm Jamie Eason and I'm in the bodybuilding.com kitchen today to show you how I make my Turkey Meatloaf Muffins.<s>
[music] You're gonna need a large bowl for this, because we've got a lot to mix up, okay, but the nice thing is is just one big bowl for everything.<s>
Okay.<s>
The first ingredient we're gonna need is a cup of quick-cooking oats.<s>
So we're gonna dump those in.<s>
Then you've got all these ingredients that we're gonna mix in with it.<s>
We've got 2 tablespoons of garlic.<s>
Now, you can either use the powdered version, or you can use the minced version.<s>
I'll show you what--I've got it over here.<s>
Here's the minced garlic.<s>
Now, this one seems to be okay.<s>
If you read the ingredients, it says, "Garlic, water.<s>
" It says, "Phosphoric acid," and no preservatives.<s>
So this one's okay.<s>
You could probably use this as an option, but some of them, be really careful.<s>
Read the label.<s>
They actually have oil in them.<s>
It won't be real prominent.<s>
It won't say it on the top.<s>
So you've gotta really check out those ingredients.<s>
This one's actually rare to be just in water.<s>
So that's an option, too, but we're gonna use the powder 'cause it's just as good that way.<s>
Okay, then we've got 1 teaspoon of salt.<s>
We've got 2 teaspoons of pepper, black pepper.<s>
We've also got 2 teaspoons of a dry mustard... just dry, yellow mustard.<s>
And sometimes if you're looking for dry yellow mustard, some people will not be able to find it in your standard jar, kind of like this one... You'll have to find it in sort of a box.<s>
It looks a little bit more like the pepper, but it's in a darker box.<s>
So I've noticed it's hard to find sometimes, and that's why.<s>
And then we've got a half teaspoon of cumin.<s>
Cumin is a really smoky spice.<s>
It's really good for you.<s>
A lot of these spices are antioxidants so they're really good for you.<s>
If you're not using a lot of spices in your food, you should start doing so.<s>
And then we also have a half teaspoon of thyme.<s>
Thyme is used a lot in poultry dishes, whether you're making chicken, turkey, or anything.<s>
And then our last ingredient is the one that makes the whole dish, so this is not the easiest to find, so this might take you a little while, but it's very well worth it.<s>
It is 2 teaspoons of a chipotle pepper seasoning.<s>
Here's--let's see if I can find it.<s>
Here's what it looks like... so hopefully you'll be able to find that.<s>
It does add some heat, so be careful.<s>
If you're not big on hot things, then maybe only add a teaspoon and a half or something like that.<s>
But I really think without it, they're a little more bland, so you definitely want the heat in there.<s>
So that's it.<s>
So I'm just gonna use my fingers and kind of get it all incorporated and mixed up...<s>
This whole recipe is pretty much about using your hands, so all right.<s>
That looks pretty good.<s>
Oh, and before I really get messy, I'm gonna take this off...<s>
So put that to the side.<s>
All right.<s>
The next thing we're gonna need is going to be chopped onions and chopped celery.<s>
Now, this is pretty convenient 'cause it just comes in the package in your produce section.<s>
I'm all about quick and easy, and this is what I'm gonna do.<s>
I hate chopping onions, so we'll open that up... and if you were to chop it, you're gonna want to do a cup of everything, so quite a bit.<s>
You know, you really can't overdo the vegetables, and if you're not a fan of celery, you can use red peppers, green peppers, anything you want.<s>
But celery and onion seem to work really well for this.<s>
But the more veggies you add, the more moisture there's gonna be in your dish, so overdo the veggies instead of under.<s>
Put that to the side.<s>
All right.<s>
The next thing we're gonna need is meat.<s>
Grab these over here.<s>
For this recipe, you can either use extra-lean ground turkey, or you can use extra-lean ground chicken breast.<s>
Either one will work really well, and actually, even beef will work, too, so get that open...<s>
Dump it in.<s>
And I'm using probably--I would say this is about probably about 2 pounds of meat.<s>
So dump that in, and it doesn't have to be exact.<s>
That's the great thing about this recipe is you kind of do it all to taste.<s>
You just dump it all in and see what you get.<s>
Then the next thing we're gonna need to add some moisture is gonna be 3 egg whites.<s>
If you're not concerned about adding any added fat, you can actually do a whole egg in there, but for this purpose, we're just gonna use the egg whites.<s>
There's one...<s>
Egg number two... and egg number three.<s>
Now, before I really get my hands in there and get dirty, I'm gonna make sure first that I have my muffin pan prepped, and I've already set the oven to 375 degrees, so make sure you preheat it and that it's ready to go before you put them in.<s>
Rinse my hands off.<s>
All right, so we're gonna prep this, because I don't want to have to stop it the middle with goopy fingers and do it.<s>
So I'm gonna use my canola oil or olive oil spray, and that is 12 muffin tins.<s>
It should make about 12.<s>
Sometimes it goes a little over.<s>
It just depends on how big or small you make them.<s>
Okay.<s>
You want to spray 'em pretty good just to make sure they don't stick.<s>
And to save my pan, 'cause I hate when they get gross, I always, always, always wipe the excess off the top, 'cause they will get pretty grodey if you start making these a lot, which is what I do, because I always have these on hand and in my refrigerator, just ready to go.<s>
You can actually keep this recipe completely frozen in your freezer and just take them out one at a time and microwave them if you want.<s>
All right.<s>
So that's ready to go.<s>
I'm gonna set that to the side.<s>
Bring this back and get busy.<s>
So take any jewelry off.<s>
This is pretty cold...So all right.<s>
Starting to look pretty grodey, which is exactly what we want.<s>
You don't want to over-mix meat too, too much.<s>
You do want to make sure you get all the spices incorporated and lift it up and get all that stuff out of there.<s>
If you over-mix meat, though, it tends to get a little more tough, so don't go crazy.<s>
Just get it all in there.<s>
Now, the nice thing about this dish, too, is that the muffin tins are what keep it in its serving size.<s>
So it's all nice and portable that way, and it's got your carb and your protein all mixed in one.<s>
Now, it is a low amount of carbs, so you could still eat them in a pita.<s>
You could add a few rice cakes or something to them.<s>
Every time I flip it, I'm still seeing spices, so I'm making sure.<s>
All right.<s>
Don't want to over-mix, so I'll stop there.<s>
All right.<s>
Now we're gonna put them in our muffin tin, and I'd say do about a racquetball size.<s>
Let's see.<s>
That might be a little larger than a racquetball size, but not too bad.<s>
We'll see how that looks.<s>
Sometimes you'll get all the way through and have to steal a little from the other one to kind of make 'em even out.<s>
There we go.<s>
You don't have to be perfect, but... Another thing is that the fact that they're in a muffin tin, this is essentially just a meatloaf.<s>
The difference is most meatloafs have, like, a ketchup base kind of in them, whether it's ketchup or tomato sauce or something inside of 'em.<s>
We've kind of left that out and just put the eggs and a lot of veggies in there, so they're not quite as moist.<s>
You can, if you want to, you can actually do what I call a thumbprint.<s>
Push it down in the middle and put like a ketchup or a barbecue sauce or something in them if you want to.<s>
They get a little slimy and a little bit messy to take with you, so only do that when you plan to eat 'em at home, I think.<s>
Okay, we're doing good.<s>
Not looking like I'm overdoing it yet.<s>
Oh, the beauty of having them in a muffin tin, not only is that it's the right portion, but the moisture from the veggies stays confined in the little tins, so it tends to keep the meat from getting overly dry.<s>
Because, you know, extra-lean ground turkey has no fat really, so really kind of just gets overcooked pretty easily.<s>
There we go.<s>
Exciting stuff watching me do this, I'm sure.<s>
Okay, it looks like I actually maybe have--I can make them a little bit bigger, so make the last one and then we'll add a little bit to a few of 'em.<s>
Now, if you were to cook these and measure them out, they would usually be about 2 and a half ounces each, so that will come to, you know, a pretty good serving size.<s>
Like, a male might eat maybe three or four of these, where a female would only eat two would be your serving.<s>
And each one of these, depending on how large you make it, is gonna be like about 78 to 80 calories, or you know, maybe a little more if you do too large of ones.<s>
These might be more like 80, 'cause I'm making 'em pretty big.<s>
I think those packages, I didn't check the exact weight of them.<s>
May have been a little bit more than 2 pounds, but that's good.<s>
I'd rather have more than less, and these are really lean, so they'll be good for us.<s>
So that looks pretty good.<s>
Rinse it off.<s>
And so to continue with the macros, about 80 calories.<s>
Maybe like 2 grams of fat.<s>
You're looking at 4 carbs and about 11 grams of protein, and that's for one muffin.<s>
So you can get 22 grams of protein for 2 muffins.<s>
All right.<s>
These are ready to go, looking pretty good.<s>
Stick them in the middle rack, and we want to cook these for quite a while.<s>
You never want uncooked turkey, and so depending on how hot your oven gets, I'm gonna put mine at about 40.<s>
But you might have to play with that.<s>
Go a little over, go a little under, and just check them as you go.<s>
All right.<s>
So we've got 40 minutes to wait, so go watch a sitcom or something and we'll come back and check 'em.<s>
All right.<s>
I think these are about done, so check 'em out.<s>
They're looking good.<s>
Let's pull 'em out.<s>
They smell good.<s>
I'll put down my potholder so that I don't burn the counter.<s>
So they look pretty good.<s>
All right.<s>
Now we just need to give 'em time to cool.<s>
I suggest that you take them out a little bit before they're completely cool and put 'em on a paper towel.<s>
I just fold it up on the counter and I put 'em on there and allow the juices that have kind of accumulated in the bottom to get a little bit dry, so that I can put 'em in a Ziploc baggie, keep 'em in the fridge for any time that I just need to grab something to go, or just looking for something good to eat.<s>
So hopefully you like the Turkey Meatloaf Muffin, and hopefully you'll come back to bodybuilding.com and check out more recipes with me.<s>

<transcript id="22" title="Healthy Recipes- Strawberry Banana Oatmeal Protein Bake " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeU3fUlle2Q" mode="non-automatic">
[music] I'm Natalie Hodson, and I'm here today in the bodybuilding.com kitchen, showing you how to make one of my favorite recipes.<s>
It's a strawberry banana oatmeal protein bake.<s>
And I like to make this sort of as a healthier version of banana bread so if I'm craving banana bread but I know it's not very healthy for me, I'll make this instead.<s>
And it's also a really good meal that you can make on the weekends.<s>
You can make it in bulk and you can keep it in your 'fridge during the week or you can also freeze it so if you have to get out the door really quickly in the morning, this is a great item you can eat for your breakfast meal.<s>
So for today's recipe, these are the ingredients that we're going to use.<s>
And we have dry ingredients and wet ingredients that we're gonna mix separately.<s>
So for our dry ingredients, we have 2 cups of old-fashioned oats and I prefer the old-fashioned oats to the instant oats just because they've been a little bit less processed.<s>
The instant oats have actually been flattened, cooked and dehydrated and so the old-fashioned oats have just been rolled and they're a little bit better for you.<s>
And then we have 4 scoops of vanilla whey protein powder.<s>
You can use any brand you prefer, just keep in mind that the different brands will make it taste slightly different.<s>
We have 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed and this is actually optional but flax seed has--is full of omega 3 fatty acids and they help reduce the LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol, and it's full of fiber and antioxidants so it just makes the recipe a little bit healthier.<s>
And when you buy the flax seed, it comes in a bag like this, it's already ground, and you usually can find that in usually in the baking aisle of your grocery store by the other flours and things like that.<s>
Then we have 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon.<s>
We have 1 teaspoon of baking powder, a fourth of a teaspoon of salt and that's just to help the baking powder rise.<s>
And then we have a 1/2 cup of Stevia in the Raw.<s>
And that's what I used for this recipe.<s>
If you had Truvia or Xylitol, you can use that as well.<s>
And then for our wet ingredients, I have a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce which is also 4 ounces.<s>
This is the kind I got.<s>
When you get your applesauce, you just want to make sure that you get one that says no sugar added or natural applesauce and the most important thing you can do is read the ingredients list so try to find one that the only ingredients are apples and water and maybe ascorbic acid and that's just vitamin C to help keep the applesauce from turning brown.<s>
And sometimes I even--what I'll do is I get the little Mott's containers that are for kids and that way it's like the perfect serving size and I have those in my cupboard for my son anyways and I'll use those sometimes.<s>
So that's a 1/2 a cup and then we have 1-1/2 cups of unsweetened vanilla almond milk.<s>
And I like to use almond milk in my recipes instead of milk because it's lower in calories and it has less sugar.<s>
And this is the kind I like.<s>
I like the Almond Breeze brand, unsweetened vanilla almond milk.<s>
It only has 40 calories.<s>
Just be careful when you're buying your almond milk because some of the flavors add quite a bit of sugar so, again, just read the ingredient list and make sure that--like, this one has 0 grams of sugar in it.<s>
And then we're gonna use a fourth of a cup of plain Greek yogurt and this is the Greek yogurt that we have today.<s>
Just, again, make sure that you're getting the non-fat plain Greek yogurt.<s>
Make sure you don't get one that's vanilla flavored or any other flavor because they're gonna add a lot of sugar.<s>
If you look at the back, it might have anywhere from 5 to 8 grams of sugar and those are the sugars that naturally occur in lactose so.<s>
And then we're gonna use four egg whites.<s>
I have my whole eggs here.<s>
We'll crack them when we make the recipe.<s>
And I have two bananas.<s>
We're gonna slice these really thin and then we have four or five strawberries and you want to get big strawberries.<s>
If they're kind of small then you can go five or even six.<s>
And those are all the ingredients we're gonna use today in our recipe.<s>
All right.<s>
So first what we're gonna do is mix all of our dry ingredients together in a bowl.<s>
So you're gonna take a larger mixing bowl and you want to put the dry ingredients in a larger mixing bowl because later we're gonna mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.<s>
So just put your wet ingredients aside for a second and then we're gonna mix 2 cups of oats, 4 scoops of protein powder, our flax seed, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of Stevia in the Raw, 1 teaspoon of baking powder and a fourth of a teaspoon of salt.<s>
And then I'm gonna take my whisk and just make sure everything gets mixed together really well.<s>
Sometimes I have gotten lazy and not mixed it together very well and my baking powder doesn't evenly distribute and then when it cooks, half of it kind of is flatter than the rest.<s>
So you just--you want to make sure that the cinnamon taste gets evenly distributed and the baking powder.<s>
And just until you can't see any more, you know, brown spots or white spots, just until it looks nice and mixed.<s>
So this looks pretty good.<s>
So we're just gonna set this to the side and then mix together our wet ingredients.<s>
And it doesn't really matter what order.<s>
We're gonna take our almond milk.<s>
Put that to the side.<s>
Our Greek yogurt.<s>
And the Greek yogurt just adds some moisture to the recipe and actually in any recipe you can substitute Greek yogurt or applesauce for the butter and the oil in the recipe.<s>
So now we're gonna put in our applesauce and just make sure you use a rubber spatula to get it all out.<s>
And then we're gonna put in our egg whites.<s>
Now a little trick that I learned.<s>
I used to just throw my egg whites in the trash can and for some reason, I could not figure out why, my house smelled bad all the time.<s>
And then one day I went to go take out the trash and it was gross.<s>
I could tell egg whites--or egg yolks were seeping through the bottom of the trash bag.<s>
And my--we've realized that it was because I was eating so many egg whites and I was throwing so many egg yolks in the trash can and so now I just throw them in the garbage disposal so that way it doesn't stink up our house.<s>
I know some people who have dogs actually let their dogs eat the egg yolks and it's good for their coats but we don't have any pets so I just do the garbage disposal.<s>
There you go.<s>
And last one.<s>
You also could do the liquid egg whites if you wanted that come in a carton.<s>
Just make sure you use a little bit less than the ratio calls for when you bake.<s>
And then I'm gonna take my--whoops--I'm gonna take my whisk and just mix this all together really well.<s>
Sometimes the egg whites can kind of stick together a little bit so just mix it until it looks nice and mixed.<s>
Then we're gonna bring over my mixed dry ingredients and we're just going to combine these.<s>
And then stir it all together.<s>
I have a 2-year-old and this is his favorite part.<s>
I let him usually do this while I'm cutting up the bananas or sometimes I'll let him cut the bananas with me.<s>
It's kind of fun to get the kids involved with this recipe.<s>
It's also a really healthy meal that you could get your kids to get some whole grains into their diet.<s>
All right.<s>
So now that that's mixed, we're gonna prepare our pan.<s>
Let's move this to the side.<s>
And we're just gonna use an 8-inch pie pan.<s>
You could use a 9-inch pie pan as well and if you don't have pie pans you could even just use a square casserole dish.<s>
And then just really lightly spray that.<s>
You don't want to use a lot of this stuff but I just use the non-stick cooking spray.<s>
And then just take your cutting board and we're gonna take one of our bananas and we're just gonna slice it really thin.<s>
So take your knife and you just do pretty thin slices because you want enough banana slices that you can layer the entire bottom of the pan.<s>
Now sometimes bananas turn color after they've been exposed to the air.<s>
And so I don't always but sometimes I've made this dish before and if I let it sit in the 'fridge for a couple of days, it kind of turns almost a purplish color so if that happens to you don't be alarmed.<s>
That's not--there's nothing wrong with it.<s>
It's just because the bananas, once they get exposed to the air, they can change color.<s>
So now what I'm doing, is I'm just taking the banana slices and lining the bottom of the pan.<s>
And after I'm done lining this, then we're gonna pour the batter on top of the bananas.<s>
So this way, when you bite into it, you have banana taste on the bottom and then we're gonna put another layer of bananas on the top.<s>
All right.<s>
So this looks pretty good.<s>
Now what we're gonna do is pour the batter on top of the bananas.<s>
And you just evenly distribute it there.<s>
It's gonna fill the pan up all the way to the edge.<s>
And then just scrape out the rest.<s>
All right.<s>
And then what we're going to do is slice our second banana and we're gonna do the same thing so we're gonna put a nice layer of bananas on the top and not only does this make it taste good, but it also makes the dish really pretty.<s>
So the thinner you slice your bananas, the more you're gonna be able to put across the pan.<s>
All right.<s>
And this recipe makes four servings so one serving really just has one egg white, a scoop of protein powder and 1/2 a cup of oats plus a little bit of Greek yogurt, a little bit of almond milk.<s>
It does have half of a banana and a little bit of spices.<s>
So this is a really good option for breakfast and if you are kind of getting tired of just regular old egg whites and oatmeal.<s>
Okay.<s>
So I didn't distribute this very evenly so I'm gonna try and scoot some of these bananas over.<s>
That looks pretty good.<s>
Then what I'm gonna do is take my strawberries and again, I'm gonna slice these fairly thin.<s>
And you don't have to add the strawberries if you don't, you know, if you don't have them, you can just do the bananas.<s>
The nice thing about this recipe is it's really versatile so you really could use any kind of fruit.<s>
I've done this before with peaches and that was pretty good.<s>
I've done it with blackberries.<s>
You could do it with apples.<s>
You could do it with raspberries, really whatever fruit's on sale that week, you could do it with.<s>
Raspberries would be really good.<s>
And then I just put the strawberries on top like that and I did four--I did four strawberries or five strawberries and just so it looks about like that.<s>
So that's it.<s>
We have the oven.<s>
I already preheated the oven to 375 degrees.<s>
So I'm gonna stick this in the oven and we are going to cook it for about 40 to 45 minutes.<s>
Basically the top is gonna get golden brown and you know it's done once you put a knife in the center and the knife comes out clean.<s>
All right.<s>
So I just took this out of the oven.<s>
We cooked it for 45 minutes and I'm just gonna test it to make sure that a knife comes out clean.<s>
It looks pretty good.<s>
And as you can see, the top of this is gonna be kind of a golden brown color and what I'm gonna do is let it sit here and rest for between 5 to 10 minutes just until it cools.<s>
If I tried to cut into it now, it would all sort of collapse together.<s>
So we're gonna let it cool and set for about 5 to 10 minutes and then after that I will cut it into fourths.<s>
One serving is one wedge.<s>
So I just usually just use a butter knife and cut through.<s>
And then sometimes I like to take my knife and run it along the side just in case--just so it doesn't stick.<s>
Right.<s>
Then I'm just gonna take a serving utensil and pull out one wedge and there you go.<s>
So what I might do is cut it in half again or just eat it like that so this looks really good.<s>
I'm gonna try a bite and see how it tastes.<s>
It tastes really, really good.<s>
I think you'll be surprised.<s>
This is one of my favorite dishes.<s>

<transcript id="23" title="Healthy Recipes-Lettuce Wrapped Turkey Muffins " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt5sv0nfyZE" mode="non-automatic">
Hi guys, Jillian Beck back with another healthy recipe with Bodybuilding.com.<s>
Today I'm gonna be showing you my lettuce-wrapped turkey muffins.<s>
I know there are a lot of turkey muffin recipes out there.<s>
This is just my version.<s>
It's pretty simple.<s>
It's very versatile so I'm just gonna show you how to put it together, give you some different options, but you can play around with it and we'll get started.<s>
It should take about 25 minutes to make altogether with the baking.<s>
It's gonna be in the oven for 20 minutes at 375 and then it takes about 5 minutes just to throw everything together.<s>
So what you're gonna need is our ground turkey.<s>
I usually go 96% and above.<s>
Right now I think this is 96% lean.<s>
If I'm closer to like a show or a photo shoot, I definitely go leaner, 99% is what I usually go with.<s>
So I got this.<s>
I basically just went through my fridge since we're doing kind of mid-week meal prepping at our house and kind of just grabbed whatever veggies I had in stock.<s>
And so we have some spinach, some bell pepper and some onions and then I usually like to throw in like a fresh herb.<s>
I've done fresh basil, I think that was last week and this week I'm gonna do some fresh cilantro.<s>
So those are the veggies we're gonna use to throw in with the ground turkey.<s>
You'll also need one egg white and then our seasonings.<s>
And I like to use Bragg's liquid aminos.<s>
It's a natural soy sauce alternative.<s>
I go with my staples of seasonings which is garlic, ginger and then a little bit of sea salt and cracked pepper.<s>
And then you'll need some cooking spray for our muffin tin and then some romaine lettuce leaves like for the hearts to wrap the turkey burger or turkey muffins in.<s>
So it's really simple, really easy.<s>
I've got the turkey already in here.<s>
I've chopped our veggies up so I'm just gonna go ahead and add those.<s>
And so you don't have to like stick with the exact veggies that I do.<s>
Definitely play around with what you like and what you have in your fridge at the time.<s>
We're gonna throw that in there.<s>
There's kind of the staples we have around.<s>
If we have some green onion, I like to throw that in there as well.<s>
If I want them spicy, I put in some chili flakes.<s>
These are just gonna be pretty standard and they're just great to have on hand during the week.<s>
You know, for quick lunches, you can break them up and put it over brown rice if you want some carbs.<s>
If we have them for dinner, I usually just wrap them in the romaine lettuce leaves and so they're really good that way.<s>
And then I put some mustard or Walden Farms like barbecue sauce is amazing so I like that as well.<s>
I'm gonna add my one egg white here.<s>
And some turkey muffins call for like quinoa flour or out flour to help bind everything but like I said, mine's pretty simple, basic.<s>
I don't have a ton of ingredients and so it's just egg white, turkey and veggies and I like to keep it simple that way.<s>
So I'm adding these spices and I don't really measure them, but I would say maybe it's like 1 teaspoon, but I just kind of go with eyeballing it since I do this all the time so.<s>
And then for the liquid aminos, I would say 1--let's see here, 1 teaspoon about so.<s>
We'll mix all these ingredients together.<s>
You can get in there with your hands too and really make sure everything is combined well.<s>
I'm just using this wooden spoon here.<s>
It's almost ready.<s>
It's kind of just a different version of the turkey burgers that I make.<s>
So when I want to do turkey burgers like if we're having a barbecue or, you know, and I want to make my own burgers, I'll do turkey burgers with a recipe very similar to this but I'll make patties and I'll grill them up and then wrap them in butter leaf lettuce.<s>
But these muffins are just super easy, especially when you're, you know, in the kitchen so much and doing a lot of meal prep.<s>
So, I just wanted to keep it simple and healthy for you guys.<s>
So that's all mixed.<s>
I'm gonna ahead and spray the muffin tin with this Pam.<s>
Good to go.<s>
I'm gonna use a spoon here too.<s>
I'd say it's like a baseball size for each muffin and we'll just pop that in there.<s>
And so if you want to find out kind of like what your macros for this meal are, definitely what I do is take like two muffins and put it on the scale and kind of measure it out and see what I'm at.<s>
I usually try to go for 3 to 4 ounces of protein and that's usually about 200 calories or less.<s>
I mean it's all just veggies in here so it's not a whole lot of anything else.<s>
So depending on what your macronutrient needs are, you can have two or three, you know, turkey muffins or more than that if you're trying to put on some more size or muscle and you need a higher dose of protein so.<s>
Almost ready here.<s>
And that made perfect 12 muffins.<s>
Put that back on here.<s>
Sit that aside.<s>
My hands are really gross right now so I'm gonna go rinse them real quick.<s>
Okay, so here are our turkey muffins before they go in the oven.<s>
So I'm gonna go ahead and put them in there at 375 for 20 minutes and I will be right back.<s>
All right, guys, so the turkey muffins are done.<s>
They've baked for about 20 minutes at 375 and I went ahead and let them cool off for about 2 minutes or so.<s>
And I've taken out the romaine lettuce hearts and I placed two muffins on there, if you can see them.<s>
And--I guess you can't but they're there.<s>
And I'll go ahead and probably put some spicy mustard on there.<s>
If I'm getting a little crazy with it, I might add some avocado, which will be a really excellent choice, especially for dinner time if you're, you know, omitting like any other carbs and you want to add some extra fats, sliced avocado on these would be excellent.<s>
So yeah, I might do some spicy mustard and avocado, but again it's your choice.<s>
You can add Walden's barbecue sauce.<s>
Some low-sugar ketchup would be good.<s>
So feel free to make it your own.<s>
It's really simple, really quick and delicious.<s>

Hilah: Hey dudes.<s>
I'm Hilah.<s>
Welcome to Hilah Cooking.<s>
Today, I have a very special guest who is the pizza expert and he's going to show you how to make homemade pizza at home.<s>
All right, so here's Brandon and him and his brother are from Detroit.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: And you all just started a pizza trailer called Via 313.<s>
Brandon: Correct.<s>
Hilah: Because 313 is Detroit's original area code.<s>
Brandon: That's so smart.<s>
Hilah: Good.<s>
All right, so we're going to make pizza today.<s>
You all specialize in Detroit style, so tell me about that.<s>
Brandon: Well, Detroit style is made with blue steel pans to make on a Sicilian styled pie, but we put the sauce on top, caramelized cheese all the way around, and we get four squares out of it.<s>
Hilah: God, sounds yummy as hell.<s>
Brandon: And it's so good.<s>
Hilah: All right, but I don't have a pizza pan.<s>
What do we do?<s>
Brandon: We're just going to make it happen with what we got in the kitchen.<s>
Hilah: Sweet!<s>
I love that.<s>
Awesome, let's make some dough.<s>
Brandon: All right.<s>
Hilah: All right, so we got just a few ingredients here.<s>
It's not like it's that complicated it seems like.<s>
Brandon: It's pretty easy.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
So you all do use bread flour.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: That's the key thing, right?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, a lot better than all-purpose flour.<s>
Most people buy all- purpose flour and you don't get the same rise out of the dough.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
And then we've got some dry yeast.<s>
Now is this what you all use in .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: In the trailer we use active dry yeast, but at home instant dry yeast is a little bit better.<s>
It's a little user friendly.<s>
Hilah: Okay, all right.<s>
So this recipe is a little modified from what they actually do so that we can make homemade pizza at home.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
So I've got my stand mixer here and I've got a bread hook on this so we can use this for kneading.<s>
If people don't have that, they can't just knead it by hand I guess.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, be old school like that.<s>
Hilah: Where did I get muscles?<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: So we're just going to put all this stuff in and turn on the thingy.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, that's pretty easy.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
So we got our yeast and we're going to put it in with the flour.<s>
Stop me when I hook up.<s>
Brandon: I'll slap the shit out of you.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
Salt and sugar.<s>
And then .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: So far.<s>
Hilah: So far, so good.<s>
Brandon: So far.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
And then oil in there too?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, did all right so far.<s>
Hilah: Thanks professor.<s>
Okay, and then I'm going to put this in here.<s>
Okay, and then what is it?<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: And turn this on?<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: Okay, so this .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Well, now it'll just go and it'll start to kind of like .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, it'll start to ball up and you'll be able to tell once it becomes one .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
etc.<s>
It's very loose right now obviously.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
So we'll just let it go for a few minutes and then we'll come back and take a look at it.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I would say five to six minutes is pretty standard.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Yeah, it's already changing, cool.<s>
Okay.<s>
So it's been like five minutes or something.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Look at that.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, it should be nice on the hands.<s>
It shouldn't stick to your fingers too bad.<s>
If it does, just throw some more flour in there.<s>
Hilah: Yeah, we added maybe a couple extra teaspoons I guess.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, just make it easy to handle for yourself.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Now we've got some flour on our bitch as they call it in the restaurant.<s>
Brandon: Yes, bitch flour.<s>
Yes, that's the fancy words for it.<s>
Hilah: It's just flour on the counter top.<s>
Brandon: This recipe should make enough for five or six pizzas.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: You can cut it.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Hilah: Pizza party!<s>
So I'll do six.<s>
Brandon: Make it four.<s>
Hilah: Make it four, okay.<s>
Brandon: So it'll be a little bit thicker.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Wow, it cuts really nice.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, it's got a nice feel to it.<s>
Hilah: And then what do you just kind of .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Well, you can ball it like this.<s>
Pull it over like that.<s>
You pull the sides and I'll pinch it at the bottom, and then make sure you cap it like that.<s>
That's what they call it.<s>
Hilah: Kind of like pinch it.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, and then the other nice restaurant ball.<s>
Hilah: Ooh!<s>
Cutsie tootsie.<s>
Brandon: You do another one.<s>
I'll do another one.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: I think yours actually looks nicer than mine.<s>
Hilah: I'm a girl.<s>
Brandon: That's what happens.<s>
Hilah: So then we'll put these in the fridge and that's an important thing that you all make sure to let it kind of rest over time.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I like to give it a good 12 or 24 hours to rest, gives it a nice flavor.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool, so start this a day ahead people.<s>
Brandon: Yes, plan ahead.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Well, this one's not quite as pretty.<s>
Let's use this one.<s>
It's the prettiest.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, thank you.<s>
I did that.<s>
Hilah: I noticed.<s>
And then I'll just kind of, I guess, a little oil in here.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, throw a little oil in there so it doesn't still too bad and it'll be easier to handle tomorrow.<s>
It won't .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: Stick to the .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
And keep it from getting like a dry out skin here.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, obviously covering it so it won't dry out too bad, but Hilah: All right.<s>
So then we'll put this in the fridge and then I'll get you back here tomorrow.<s>
Brandon: I'll meet you tomorrow.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
Brandon: Maybe, I don't know.<s>
Hilah: Well, if you're not drunk.<s>
Okay, so here we are again.<s>
Nice outfit.<s>
Brandon: Thank you.<s>
Hilah: He did not spend the night here.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
So we got our raised doughs.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, and what you want to do is kind of make love to it.<s>
Don't go in there and bang it all out.<s>
Just the more you mess it up the harder it'll be.<s>
Hilah: Am I messing it up?<s>
Brandon: You're destroying it.<s>
Hilah: Oh, God.<s>
I am.<s>
I'm sorry.<s>
Brandon: There you go.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Because we don't want to like bust all the air out, right?<s>
Brandon: No, well again, the easier it is to handle right here.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: So what you want to do is make a little crust.<s>
So imagine a pizza on your table.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Come on, get with it.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
I was going to watch.<s>
I don't make it.<s>
Brandon: No, make a little crust.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Flip it over.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: And then .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: Keep doing it.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Now, flip it over again.<s>
All right.<s>
You can push out the gas in the middle, but don't mess up the crust that you started.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Yours looks better than mine.<s>
Brandon: Now use your knuckles to stretch it.<s>
Just pull it apart and Hilah: Oh!<s>
Brandon: Ah, geez!<s>
Hilah: Party foul.<s>
Pizza party foul.<s>
Brandon: Yes, you can stretch it about [inaudible that.<s>
Put your hand back and stretch it.<s>
Put your hand back, just pull it apart with your knuckles like that.<s>
There you go.<s>
That ain't going to tear on you.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
This pretty cool.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I think this is the most intimidating part that people get a little freaked out about making pizza.<s>
And if it does tear on you, just pinch it together and there you go.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Just patch it?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, just patch it together.<s>
Hilah: You did that on purpose .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: I did that on .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
to show us how to fix it.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, exactly.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: That's what I tell people.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: Keep stretching with your knuckles until you get about a 12 inch pie.<s>
I think yours is pretty good actually.<s>
round.<s>
Brandon: Let's destroy it, so we can be done with it.<s>
Hilah: It's the pizza expert, okay?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I'm done with it and so that's good.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
We just don't need one anyway.<s>
Brandon: That's good, yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Because I'm not hungry.<s>
All right.<s>
We can use that.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
So now we put some toppings on.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, so let's go ahead and put a little flour on this.<s>
Most people don't have these at home.<s>
Hilah: Right.<s>
Brandon: You can use just a cardboard box and throw a little flour on the cart.<s>
I'm not hungry.<s>
Brandon: Geez!<s>
A fucking shit show over here.<s>
So no matter what you do it's going to lose its shape and form.<s>
So once you get it on your cardboard box or if you're fancy and have a [inaudible restructure it to a nice round size.<s>
I won't keep saying pie because most people here in Texas don't call it a pie.<s>
Hilah: Right.<s>
Yankee.<s>
Brandon: There it is.<s>
Hilah: Just kidding.<s>
Welcome Yankee.<s>
Brandon: I don't have ten years underneath from some [inaudible Hilah: Okay.<s>
Wow!<s>
Brandon: That's a good start right there.<s>
Hilah: That looks awesome.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
So we'll get some sauce and cheeses.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, I don't know where it's at.<s>
Hilah: Oh, you know what?<s>
I made sauce.<s>
Brandon: Where is it?<s>
There it is.<s>
It's a little easier if you put it in the center.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: I put a pretty good mound in the center all the time and just kind of swirl it out into the crust.<s>
You should be able to see where your crust was.<s>
Hilah: And I can see it on mine, yeah.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, a little bit.<s>
If you have an imagination just make it happen.<s>
Hilah: So we don't want to like saturate it.<s>
Brandon: No, just give it a good .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
And sometimes it's better to put a little bit up at the top because it'll all kind of bleed through the center once it starts baking.<s>
Hilah: Oh, okay.<s>
A little heavier on the edges.<s>
Brandon: So I like to put a little .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Yeah, a little heavier on the edges especially because the crust tends to dry out a little bit.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: And then just let it kind of bleed through, through the center.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: So that's the beautiful saucing.<s>
Hilah: Awesome.<s>
And then the cheesing happens next.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
We got our moz.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, we'll do it together.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: This is a whole milk mozzarella.<s>
It bakes up a little bit nicer.<s>
It's got a little bit higher fat content than like a Kraft, a little moister cheese that you'd get at .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
you know?<s>
Hilah: Like pre-shredded kind of stuff.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, if you want to be cheap.<s>
It's like a buck more a pound, but you'll taste the quality.<s>
It's already got a nice salt content so it'll pull the mozzarella flavor out of it.<s>
Hilah: Yum.<s>
Brandon: Again, kind of the same with the sauce.<s>
With the cheese you want to put a little bit more around the edges.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Not hit the crust, but let it kind of bleed through.<s>
It'll all melt towards the center.<s>
That's pretty good right there.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
So we got our moz, now we get our pepps.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
And this is some kind of .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Brandon: These are natural casing pepperonis.<s>
This is what we use back in Michigan and we're trying to bring a little flavor back to Texas from Detroit.<s>
These will shrink up, cup and charr.<s>
We call them grease cups back at home.<s>
Hilah: Mm!<s>
I love that kind.<s>
Brandon: Yes, but you don't find it around here too much though.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: Just whatever you want to do.<s>
Hilah: Just get it on there.<s>
Brandon: Who cares?<s>
Hilah: Jesus.<s>
Brandon: Whatever.<s>
There it is.<s>
Hilah: Show is over.<s>
Brandon: Here.<s>
Just put some so it's not on the crust though.<s>
But for real, these will melt, cook up nice, so whatever.<s>
It doesn't have to be pretty because they'll do their own thing.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
Let's put it in the oven.<s>
Brandon: That's beautiful.<s>
So again, we're using our fancy peel from the restaurant or the trailer.<s>
We have a stone in here.<s>
It's preheated about 550 degrees.<s>
If you give it a good shake, again, if you're using a pizza box at home, you could use a little bit of flour on the box and just kind of give it a good shaking on there, make love to it, and let it do its thing.<s>
It should take about ten minutes and it should be ready to go.<s>
Hilah: Okay, cool.<s>
If people don't have a pizza stone, what can they use?<s>
Brandon: A pizza stone, you can use just a regular aluminum sheet pan.<s>
This cooks up real nicely.<s>
You'll get a nice crisp on the bottom or as you said we could use a cast-iron upside down, make a mini personal pie.<s>
Hilah: A smaller one.<s>
Brandon: Yeah.<s>
Hilah: Cool.<s>
Brandon: But stone works the best.<s>
They're only about 15 bucks.<s>
Hilah: Awesome.<s>
Brandon: And a local art shop.<s>
Hilah: Voila!<s>
Awesome.<s>
Okay.<s>
Brandon: Now you're cutting it now so go ahead.<s>
Hilah: I have to cut it?<s>
Brandon: Yeah, cut it in eighths, cut it in half.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: Just, you know .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: My girl muscles are tiny.<s>
Brandon: Put those mashed potatoes into it.<s>
Don't do that.<s>
All right.<s>
This is sad.<s>
Brandon: Forget it.<s>
So we'll cut it in half.<s>
Hilah: Let's have a man do it.<s>
Brandon: Yes.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: I can't guarantee you get a .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: So not like back and forth and sawing it.<s>
Brandon: No, don't do that because you'll have 18 different pieces out of that.<s>
Hilah: Okay.<s>
Brandon: So this is what we have here.<s>
Hilah: Cheers.<s>
Brandon: Beautiful, cheers.<s>
Hilah: Yay!<s>
Mm.<s>
Brandon: Everything is good except for the sauce.<s>
I don't know what happened.<s>
Hilah: Oh, my God.<s>
My mom did it.<s>
That was weird.<s>
Brandon: I don't really know what happened with the sauce, but the cheese, the pepperoni, the crust, perfect.<s>
Hilah: Dude!<s>
This is awesome.<s>
Brandon: The sauce is .<s>
.<s>
.<s>
Hilah: Wow!<s>
Dude, pizza party!<s>
Brandon: You guys can buy Ragu at the store or whatever.<s>
Hilah: He's funny.<s>
Anyway, I'm going to be having a pizza party for my New Years.<s>
What are you going to be doing?<s>
Thanks for coming on the show Brandon, pizza face.<s>
Brandon: Thank you for having me and my beard.<s>
Hilah: No problem.<s>
You should have a beard net really.<s>
There's hair all in my pizza.<s>
Brandon: Yeah, this is a hairy pizza.<s>
Hilah: All right.<s>
Bye!<s>
Thank you for watching.<s>
Brandon: See you.<s>
Hilah: See you.<s>
Brandon: Warm up.<s>
Man: That's great.<s>
Brandon: All right.<s>
I'm ready.<s>

<transcript id="25" title="How to Make Watermelon Cookies " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wzOj6YUpHE" mode="non-automatic">
Hi, I'm Eugenie.<s>
Today I'm making watermelon cookies.<s>
Those cookies are really easier than you think and it takes only several everyday ingredients.<s>
It's basically a French biscuit sable recipe which is a slightly modified version of my French coffee sables.<s>
First, in a mixing bowl, I will add in ½ cup of softened unsalted butter  and 1/3 cup of granulated sugar.<s>
And whisk until light and fluffy.<s>
And add in 1 egg yolk.<s>
Remaining egg white will be used later.<s>
And add in ½ teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and a generous pinch of salt.<s>
And whisk until homogenous.<s>
Now sift in 1 and ¼ cups of all-purpose flour and fold until combined.<s>
Now divide the batter into half.<s>
First I will make red dough by adding some red food color and kneading.<s>
This method is called 'fraiser' and you can mix without making the dough too tough with this method.<s>
And make a 2 inch diameter cylinder and cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.<s>
Then take out half of the remaining vanilla dough and cover with plastic wrap.<s>
Then roll out.<s>
And chill in the refrigerator.<s>
And with the remaining dough make a green dough.<s>
Today I'm using both matcha, Japanese green tea powder, and green food color.<s>
And again I will knead until homogenous and cover with plastic wrap.<s>
Then roll out.<s>
And chill in the refrigerator.<s>
Now bring red dough and vanilla dough to working surface.<s>
Measure the size of the red cylinder and cut out the sides of the vanilla dough  and roll out to lengthen it.<s>
And place the red cylinder over it and carefully roll up like a yoga mat.<s>
Now cut off the surplus vanilla dough.<s>
Repeat with the green.<s>
By the way the cookie dough should be cooled a little before rolling, otherwise the dough will be too soft and won't hold the shape well.<s>
Now cover the dough with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.<s>
Now make a colored sugar.<s>
In a plastic bag, add in a little bit of green food color and spread with fingers to avoid any green color lumps.<s>
And add in sugar and mix well until homogenous.<s>
This is a simple way to make colored sugar at home.<s>
And make a sugar bed.<s>
Then break one egg white and brush on the cookie dough.<s>
And roll the dough over sugar bed.<s>
French sable cookies need sugar decoration.<s>
And slice the dough half inch thick.<s>
And arrange the disks on a cookie pan.<s>
And decorate with toasted black sesame seeds.<s>
I love the mixed flavor of green tea and sesame seeds.<s>
But if you don't have sesame seeds, use mini chocolate chips.<s>
Again I will chill the pan in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes  and then bake in the oven preheated to 350 degrees F. (175 C) for about 10-12 minutes.<s>
Out of oven immediately cut the cookies in half and let cool for 5 minutes.<s>
Then transfer to a wire rack.<s>
Voila!<s>
Watermelon cookies.<s>
They are so so cute!<s>
I love them.<s>
It's French sable cookie style, so there are little cracks.<s>
Bon appetit.<s>
My dad really like sable cookies and I also love those crumbly biscuit sables!<s>

<transcript id="26" title="Jelly Roll Ice Cream Bombe Recipe - Laura Vitale - Laura in the Kitchen Episode 790 " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fop7aHj2VFo" mode="non-automatic">
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the Kitchen, I want to share with you, my recipe for what I call my jelly roll ice cream bombe.<s>
Now, there are so many variations you can make, and definitely let me know if you want to see a different variation than this one, leave it in the comments down below.<s>
But, today I want to share with you, sort of my - it's a jelly roll, it has strawberry jam in there and then it's going to be with strawberry ice cream and mango sorbet.<s>
It's phenomenal!<s>
It looks incredible, it couldn't be easier.<s>
You could definitely take a shortcut and buy a jelly roll already pre-made, but today I figured since I already have my ice cream and sorbet done, we'd make the jelly roll together!<s>
The ingredients you will need to make the actual jelly roll are very plain and simple once,s you will need all purpose flour, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, some eggs that I have separated into yolks and whites, vanilla paste or you can use vanilla extract, and some milk.<s>
The oven is preheated to 375F, I also have a 15 by 10 inch baking pan here that I've lined with parchment - and you want to make sure that you spray it with non-stick spray as well because it can stick, even to parchment paper.<s>
So, precaution.<s>
Now I'm going to make everything in my standing mixer just because it's really easy, and the first thing I'm going to do, is I'm actually going to whip the egg whites.<s>
I'm going to take my egg whites and put them in my standing mixer, make sure your standing mixer is clean.<s>
And I'm just going to whisk these until they're really light and frothy, and light stiff peaks, and when they're there, I'll show you what they look like!<s>
They look good!<s>
I don't need them to be too, too stiff.<s>
I'm actually going to switch attachments, I"m going to now take my paddle attachment to finish the rest of the batter, but first, I just want to get the whites out because I don't need them until the end but I wanted to do them first because egg whites do not whip if your bowl is dirty, so in a case like this, get the egg whites done first, and then make the rest of your batter.<s>
That way you don't have to dirty up another bowl.<s>
Okay, I'm adding my egg yolks and my sugar, and now I'm going to just put on my paddle attachment.<s>
I'm going to cream those together until they're really light and pale and fluffy.<s>
It'll take a couple of minutes but you're not doing it by hand, so let it go until it's nice, pale and nice and fluffy looking!<s>
That looks excellent!<s>
I"m just going to add in a spoonful of my vanilla paste - by all means, you can use vanilla extract, but I'm going to use vanilla paste because I really want that vanilla flavor.<s>
Blend that in, just for a quick second - doesn't have to be perfect.<s>
Lower this down.<s>
Mix together my flour with the baking powder and the salt.<s>
Going to add that in.<s>
Whew!<s>
Along with my milk.<s>
And then we're going to pull this back up and then just mix it until it's all combined.<s>
And you do want this to be fairly, sort of smooth, but don't over mix it otherwise it can get a little bit tough.<s>
That is looking gorgeous, but we do have to fold in the egg whites, so I"m just going to do that with my spatula so that I don't deflate them too much.<s>
But try to get all the batter off your little beater here, or your paddle attachment.<s>
As much of it as you can, anyway.<s>
I love to always give everything a good stir from the sides and the bottom.<s>
And now I'm going to add in my egg whites.<s>
Going to do half at a time so that I don't deflate them and I can kind of work quickly.<s>
And you can see I'm folding it, I take my spatula, stick it right in the middle, and then you fold over.<s>
Stick in the middle, fold over.<s>
That's such a gorgeous batter!<s>
I love that you can see the bubbles from the egg whites, that's just going to give you really beautiful, light cake.<s>
Okay!I'm going to do my best to flatten this as even as I can manage with my spatula.<s>
Don't panic if it's not perfect, because let's face it, no one will know the difference.<s>
And I just always like to move around the pan because I think that just makes it easier.<s>
Get it as evenly as possible.<s>
Excellent!<s>
Okay, this is going to go into your preheated oven at 375F for twelve to fourteen minutes, or until it's a lovely light golden color and cooked all the way through.<s>
Since this is pretty thin it shouldn't take that long.<s>
I'm going to put this in and as soon as it comes out, I will show you the next step!<s>
My cake is completely cooked, it cooked for exactly fourteen minutes, and I always take a toothpick - you can even take a dry piece of spaghetti - stick it in the thickest part, if there's no wet batter on it, it's good!<s>
Now, let it cool for about two to three minutes, no longer - maybe five.<s>
Now, what I have here is a lint free kitchen towel, about the same size as the cake, and I'm going to cover this in some confectioner sugar because we need to roll this up.<s>
So you want to make sure that you sprinkle some sugar, don't worry if it gets on your counter, it's totally fine.<s>
And now I'm going to - now I did take a knife - a butter knife and it just releases really easily because I did, I did grease it really, really well.<s>
And I'm just going to invert this, just like so, if it sticks, do not panic.<s>
You see, making sure that it is really nice - oops!<s>
- and greased, really helps, and then I just try to straighten it as best as I can.<s>
And now I'll roll this around this way, so you can see exactly what I'm doing, how about that?<s>
Now just - you fold, literally, the towel in the cake.<s>
Shorting.. shorting?<s>
Ha, I started from one of the shorter ends and just roll this tightly, but not too tight.<s>
Just like that, and that will take the shape of the jelly roll.<s>
Now this has to cool completely, it could take a couple of hours, so I'm going to place this on a cooling rack, allow it to cool completely, and then we'll move on to the next step.<s>
Now, I did - I do have my ice cream in the freezer already, I've got strawberry ice cream and I've got my mango sorbet.<s>
But I do know a great website - LauraintheKitchen.com - who has both recipes for you if you want to make them from scratch, or if you want to take a shortcut and buy them at the grocery store.<s>
The choice is entirely up to you.<s>
I'm going to let this cool completely and then we'll move onto the next step.<s>
Now, this was cooling for a couple of hours, and now I'm going to unwrap it.<s>
And don't worry if it looks wonky because that's - you know, you want it to do that.<s>
Because you want it to go back into its same shape.<s>
And now, what I have here is some strawberry preserves, you could use whatever preserve you'd like.<s>
I mean, it's totally up to you.<s>
And what I'm doing is I'm just spreading a nice thin layer of this.<s>
I'm not going to go all the way up, because as I roll this it will squeeze out.<s>
And as you can see there are some actual pieces of strawberries here and there so I'm going to try and get this as even as possible.<s>
Kind of concentrating with leaving about an inch or so from all sides open, because, again when this gets rolled it does kind of squeeze out which is totally fine, but I don't want to overdo it.<s>
This looks good enough, I don't want it to be too, too thick.<s>
I'd say that looks perfect to me, could use a spatula, but clearly a spoon works really, really well.<s>
And now, I'm going to just roll this back up, this time you are not going to roll the kitchen towel in it.<s>
Going to roll it just like that.<s>
Perfect.<s>
And now, I'm going to put this - see it squeezes out a little tiny bit - we didn't put too, too much, so that should be good.<s>
Okay, I'm going to place this here, I'm going to just wrap this with some plastic wrap, just a little bit because I don't want this to get sort of hard, and I'm going to pop it into the fridge for around a half hour, or until it kind of sets and holds its shape, and then we will get ready to start building our bombe - ice cream bombe.<s>
My jelly roll was in the fridge for about an hour, now let me show you what I have here.<s>
I have a large bowl, and don't worry about the dimensions and the measurements and everything because I will write everything in detail on, you know, on the recipe and it will be on LauraintheKitchen.com.<s>
And I've taken a bowl and I've lined it well with some parchment - with some plastic wrap - and you want to make sure that the plastic wrap is overhanging.<s>
I have a smaller bowl, which I'll show you what I'm going to do with it later.<s>
I have got some strawberry ice cream.<s>
I have left it out at room temperature for about fifteen minutes I would say, you want this to be a little soft and easy for you to work with, and then I also have an orange - some orange juice, I just took an orange and squeezed it.<s>
Okay, let's get going, using a serrated knife, I am going to cut slices of my jelly roll.<s>
Now, I'm not going to cut them too, too thick, actually would it be better if I just used this?<s>
Nah it wouldn't.<s>
I'm going to just cut my slices, not too thick, not too thin, about, I would say about a half an inch thick or maybe a little bit less than that.<s>
Now I'm just taking slices of my jelly roll, and if you need to tighten them up a bit, you can, I really do not do this in any particular order, I don't worry about things looking perfect, because the end result is just so delightful that it does not matter.<s>
And you just want to make sure that you cover the sides and the bottom of your bowl.<s>
You can cut them to fit, too.<s>
Totally fine.<s>
Just like taking a little bit of my orange juice and just drizzling it on the cake, it keeps it a little bit more moist and sometimes - and I'm going to be very honest with you - depending on who I'm making this for, depending on the time of year, sometimes I do a little grand marnier, sometimes I'm doing a cherry base, I do a little cherry brandy.<s>
Doesn't matter, but today, I'm using orange juice.<s>
Okay, the ice cream should be softened enough at this point because you do need to be able to maneuver this around, and that is looking good.<s>
And if it peeks through the little holes, then that's fine.<s>
I just do like that, and then you kind of push it on the sides, just like so.<s>
Try to get it as even as you can, and I'll show you what we're going to do with that bowl in just a minute because the center is going to be where we put our mango sorbet.<s>
But not just yet, otherwise everything would kind of blend all together.<s>
So, I'm just going to do this as even as possible, as quickly as possible because I don't want the ice cream to melt too quickly.<s>
Then I take my bowl, I make sure it's a clean bowl, and you want to make sure that it just fits perfect.<s>
And I'm going to do it just like that, sorry if I'm moving a little fast, but we're dealing with ice cream.<s>
Okay, now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to wrap the sides like this, pop this into the freezer for about an hour or so, or until the strawberry ice cream is fully frozen again and then we'll get going with the last final layer!<s>
Now I actually popped this into the freezer overnight - I had a hair appointment - what can I say?<s>
A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do!<s>
Hah!<s>
And it's also even better because that way you can completely forget about it and it gets nice and frozen.<s>
Now, a quick tip: when you have your bowl in there, it's going to be quite frozen, so what I do is I take a kitchen towel, and I sort of run it under hot water and then sit my kitchen towel in the bowl for a couple minutes until it kind of starts to thaw the ice cream right around the bowl just a little bit and then it comes out super easy and simple.<s>
Now, what I have here is some mango sorbet, and it's at room temperature - well not at room temperature, I left it out at room temperature for a bit because I want this to be really nice and smooth and pliable.<s>
Now that I removed the bowl, I'm going to fill this with my mango sorbet.<s>
That looks really lovely, I'm going to save that for myself.<s>
I'm going to cover this back up with my plastic wrap because you want to make sure it's nice and covered.<s>
I'm actually going to take this little plate and just sort of squeeze everything together.<s>
Now, I'm going to pop this back into the freezer for several hours, it needs to - the mango sorbet needs to be completely frozen, it could take up to a couple of hours, and then it will be time to unveil this beauty.<s>
So once everything is frozen, and solid, it's good to go - now what I've done, I've just taken a small paring knife and just gone around the edges, and just kind of sliced them so it's just almost one flat layer that way it holds better - it doesn't wobble as much when you try to cut it - but don't throw them away.<s>
Cooks treat, you always have to have one of those, it's the best part of the job.<s>
Now you're ready to serve it!<s>
It's very simple.<s>
Now what I have here is my platter, this is just a cake stand, a round cake stand.<s>
I'm going to flip this around.<s>
Now, we have plastic wrap, so that really helps make the job a lot easier.<s>
I'm just going to take my chef's knife and I'm kind of dunking it into warm water, now I'm drying it off on a clean kitchen towel.<s>
And it'll go in really easy.<s>
And that makes for a really nice, clean - now this is a really big slice, because mainly I want to show you what - how beautiful this is on the outside.<s>
I mean the outside is just gorgeous, and the inside is going to be even prettier, so I take that.<s>
Look at that!<s>
Is that not beautiful?!<s>
Now, what you can do, you can also make this multiple layer.<s>
So instead of doing two layers of ice cream like I did, you could do cherry ice cream, chocolate, and just do a bunch of different layers, that would be really fun.<s>
But I like this combination because I think the jelly roll with the strawberry jam and then the strawberry ice cream, which is so creamy and delicious, with the mango sorbet, I think it's absolute magic.<s>
I'm going to give this a try.<s>
That looks beautiful Let's give this a go, I'm going to have to hold on just a little bit because it's a really big piece.<s>
Yeah, I want that right there.<s>
I want a little bit of everything.<s>
I was going to do this, because I'm so used to it!<s>
Mmm.<s>
Very cold though.<s>
That is awesome.<s>
It's got like everything you could possibly want.<s>
Really cold though!<s>
Ohh!<s>
That's really cold!<s>
It has everything you could possibly want, a beautiful sweet sponge cake, a little sweetness from the jam, the combination of the strawberry and the mango is like a match made in food heaven.<s>
And it really couldn't be easier.<s>
You can make this way ahead of time if you do have a dinner party you want to make this for.<s>
Perfect for Summer.<s>
Hope you have enjoyed spending time with me, go to LauraintheKitchen.com to get the written recipe.<s>
Let me know if you have a specific combination you like with your ice cream bombe, because I would love to try new combinations.<s>
I'll see you next time.<s>

<transcript id="27" title="Jjajangmyeon Recipe 짜장면 Korean Black Bean Noodle " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDK-ZtF7-hk" mode="non-automatic">
Hi, I’m Eugenie.<s>
Today I’m so excited because I’m making a delicious dish, Jjangjangmyun,  which is one of the most popular Korean dishes.<s>
It’s a Koeanized Chinese dish.<s>
For this recipe you will need:  pork, black bean paste, potato, onion, zucchini, vegetable oil, sugar,  cornstarch or potato starch, minced garlic, and oyster sauce.<s>
First, heat a large deep frying pan over medium high heat.<s>
And add in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil,  today I’m using grape seed oil.<s>
And add in 2 garlic cloves, minced.<s>
Then add in 5 ounces of pork.<s>
Normally pork is used for jjajangmyun, and I am using pork tender-loin.<s>
And season with salt and pepper.<s>
And cook for about 4 minutes.<s>
Then add in 1 medium potato, diced.<s>
I’m adding in potato first because it should be cooked thoroughly.<s>
And cook for about 3 minutes.<s>
And 1 medium onions, roughly chopped.<s>
I know it’s a lot of onion.<s>
Jjangjangmyun at restaurants has a lot of onions.<s>
But of course adjust the amount as you like.<s>
And 1/3 medium zucchini, diced.<s>
Then stir fry for another 3 minutes.<s>
And make a hole in the center of the frying pan.<s>
And I will add in 3 tablespoons of chunjang, black bean paste.<s>
Without black bean paste, you cannot make jjajangmyon.<s>
3 tablespoons.<s>
And 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of sugar.<s>
And stir to fry making a little circle for about 2 minutes.<s>
This is very important because Jjangjang means fried sauce in Chinese.<s>
And mix all together until the veggies are well covered.<s>
Hm, it smells good.<s>
The fried sauce.<s>
Then add in 1 and 1/3 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of oyster sauce.<s>
Oyster sauce will give rich flavor to jjajang.<s>
And bring it to a boil.<s>
And in a cup,  add in 2 tablespoons of cornstarch  and the 2 tablespoons of water  and mix all togther until well mixed.<s>
Don’t add the cornstarch directly to the pan, it won’t dissolve very well.<s>
Ok, Now add in the boiling jjajang sauce.<s>
And bring it to a boil  And reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened.<s>
And now for the noodle.<s>
Cook fresh noodle according to the package directions.<s>
Any noodles will do but fresh Chinese style noodle is the best for Jjangjangmyun.<s>
And if you want Jjangjangbop, just serve with rice instead of noodle.<s>
And drain the noodle and wash with cold water.<s>
Be careful because it’s very hot.<s>
Voila!<s>
And sauce.<s>
Jjajangmyon.<s>
The noodle with hot jjajang sauce.<s>
Jjajangmyon is better with cucumber, danmuji, onions, and vinegar.<s>
Bon appetit.<s>
This is why I love fresh noodle.<s>
And black bean sauce is really intense and bold.<s>
This is absolutely a must dish for Korean food lovers and curious people.<s>
And I have many delicious Korean recipes in my “foods in Korea” playlist.<s>
Thank you for watching.<s>
See you soon.<s>
Bye.<s>

<transcript id="28" title="Outback Steakhouse Baked Potato " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwtkD_4-WB4" mode="non-automatic">
This is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.<s>
I'm going to show you how you can make a baked potato that's just like the Outback Steakhouse, with that wonderful salty crust on the outside, so let's get started and solve this mystery.<s>
We're going to start out with baked potatoes, now use as many as you like.<s>
Now I'm using some that are roughly the size of my hand.<s>
I'm guessing that's about a half pound.<s>
You're going to need some kosher salt, which you can buy at your regular grocery store.<s>
If you haven't tried it, it's a great ingredient to use for salt, lots of flavor.<s>
We're going to use a vegetable oil.<s>
It doesn't matter.<s>
You can use just vegetable oil, sunflower, safflower, corn oil.<s>
I would stay away from olive oil and peanut oil, simply because I think that can add a little extra flavor that I'm not quite looking for here.<s>
Now you don't need to pierce your baked potato with a fork or a knife or anything.<s>
You're just going to dip a paper towel into a small container and just rub the whole potato down with oil.<s>
We're doing this so the salt crust will stick on it, and this does another thing, as well.<s>
It keeps the potato nice and light and fluffy in the inside, because we're not losing any of the potato's natural water, so it really works out well.<s>
So by now you've preheated your oven to about 350 degrees.<s>
It's heating away and it's getting ready for us.<s>
The next thing we're going to do is we're just sprinkle on some salt.<s>
Now we're not going to wrap these in foil, because this could knock off a little bit of the salt, so that's it.<s>
We're just going to sprinkle it with salt.<s>
Then we're going to pop it into our 350 degree oven.<s>
I'm going to bake these until they're done, and for me that takes about an hour, so probably close to an hour for you as well.<s>
Go head, put these in the oven, and then take them back out.<s>
Let them cool for a little bit, but you can see the salty crust has remained.<s>
These are wonderful, light, and fluffy on the inside, so I want to show you what this looks like a little bit closer.<s>
How fabulous is that?<s>
That's perfect.<s>
I love the underside, because it browns just a little bit.<s>
It gets a little big crispy on the bottom.<s>
I don't think there's anything much better than that.<s>
So here we go, here's our baked potato.<s>
I'm going to go ahead and cut this open.<s>
You can see again, the salt stays right on the top, to make it so delicious.<s>
Now I'm going to ahead and prepare this baked potato.<s>
Now of course, it's still screaming hot, so use a towel.<s>
Use something other than your fingers at this point, because burning yourself before dinner is never fun.<s>
What comes next?<s>
Well, of course, we're going to top our baked potato with our favorite ingredients of our choice.<s>
I'm a butter and sour cream, kind of girl, but as you can see these are really easy to do.<s>
You just need a baked potato, a little bit of vegetable oil.<s>
Again, your choice is fine, and some kosher salt.<s>
That's like the potato, the non-negotiable ingredient, and we're going to bake these.<s>
They take about an hour in a 350 degree oven and that's it.<s>
How wonderful is that?<s>
So here we go, we're topping our baked potato with a little bit of butter, sour cream, and chives, and that's how you can make a baked potato, just like they do at the Outback Steakhouse.<s>

<transcript id="29" title="Perfect Soufflé Recipe - How to Make Sweet Soufflé " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc1DtH-OC94" mode="non-automatic">
Eugenie Kitchen Hi, I am Eugenie.<s>
Today I am going to make "Soufflé à la vanille", vanilla Soufflé.<s>
Soufflé, it puffs up in the oven and it falls down so quickly.<s>
So, there is a famous French saying, “Le souffle n’attend pas, on attend le soufflé.” That means le soufflé doesn’t wait for us, we (the guests) wait for le soufflé.<s>
But today we will not wait for le soufflé, we will make  the soufflé.<s>
For this recipe, you will need: 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (14g), 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour ( 10g), 1 /2 cup of milk (120 ml), 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons of caster sugar (30g), 2 eggs, and a pinch of salt.<s>
First, with butter at room-temperature, brush the ramekins.<s>
Brush from bottom upwards.<s>
This will make the soufflé to rise evenly.<s>
Then, with caster sugar coat the ramekins.<s>
And shake out any excess.<s>
And set aside.<s>
On medium heat, add the butter in the sauce pan and melt it.<s>
Add in the flour and with a wooden spoon stir for about 1 minute.<s>
In the microwave, I made the milk hot.<s>
Out of the heat, gradually add hot milk, and stir until smooth and combined.<s>
Back to medium heat stir constantly until it comes to a boil.<s>
Remove from the heat.<s>
The texture should be like this.<s>
This is white sauce.<s>
Now add in salt and vanilla extract and stir until combined.<s>
Separate the egg white and egg yolk.<s>
Then add in the egg yolks one by one into white sauce and stir to combine.<s>
The sauce pan is still warm, so pour the sauce into a separate bowl to prevent unwanted evaporation.<s>
And set aside.<s>
Now, whisk egg whites.<s>
It is not mixing.<s>
It is incorporating the air like this.<s>
Keep whisking until firm peaks form.<s>
Add gradually sugar while slowly whisking.<s>
Keep whisking until soft peaks form.<s>
This is French meringue.<s>
It takes about 20 minutes with hand.<s>
Then, add about one third of the French meringue into the white sauce and whisk until homogeneous.<s>
Then, pour all white sauce into meringue and whisk until just combined.<s>
Now, spoon the mixture into ramekin.<s>
Run thumb around inside of the rim.<s>
This will help the soufflé to rise straight.<s>
Bake at 390 degrees F (200 C.) for 12 to 15 minutes or until very well risen.<s>
Immediately serve on a plate.<s>
And dust with confectioners' sugar.<s>
soufflé... Risen straight and evenly.<s>
And it has golden brown top and pale yellow inside.<s>
This is classic French soufflé.<s>
It is very delicate and hot mousse.<s>
Thank you for watching!<s>
Bye for now.<s>

<transcript id="30" title="Rotel Cheese Dip " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR9xELaq9UE" mode="non-automatic">
This is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.<s>
Today I am going to show you how you can make Ro-Tel Cheese Dip in two different ways.<s>
This is one of my favorite party foods to make.<s>
It is easy and tastes great.<s>
Again, I said this is easy.<s>
This only has two ingredients; the first being Velveeta cheese and the next being a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes.<s>
Now the ratio is easy, easy to remember, it's one pound of Velveeta cheese to one can of Ro-Tel tomatoes.<s>
Now I like to heat mine up on the stove, just because I think it's easier than pulling it in and out of the microwave, and stirring it and trying to make sure it's all perfectly melted.<s>
This takes only about three to five minutes, and you will have some perfectly made Ro-Tel dip.<s>
So again, there it was.<s>
That took me about three to five minutes to make, and now I'm going to spoon this up and put it in a dish and get it ready.<s>
So but you know what?<s>
While this is really good, we can make this Ro-Tel Cheese Dip better.<s>
So I'm going to show you how you can jazz up your Ro-Tel cheese dip; sausage.<s>
You're going to brown a pound of sausage, so go ahead, and cook that thoroughly, because we are going to put this into our cheese sauce, so you want to make sure it is completely browned all the way through.<s>
So again, I'm starting out with that same pot of Ro-Tel dip and that is one pound of Velveeta to two cans of Ro-Tel.<s>
I'm adding in sour cream, cream cheese and the next ingredient I am going to add in is that sausage.<s>
That cooked sausage is going to go in here, as well.<s>
Now for the exact ingredients and recipe, please go to my website.<s>
It's there I list it for you.<s>
A little bit of garlic powder, and then I'm going to go ahead and stir this together a little bit, before I put in my pickled jalapeno slices.<s>
I like to use the pickled ones, simply because they're not as raw-tasting, and I think the heat's a little bit more consistent.<s>
So if you like your cheese dip a little spicier, hey, add some more or even add some of that jalapeno pickle juice.<s>
You can see how that's rich and creamy and full of goodies, so hey, there's Ro-Tel Cheese Dip two different ways.<s>

<transcript id="31" title="S'Mores Cookie Cups Recipe - Laura Vitale - Laura in the Kitchen Episode 801 " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1BcYmNA27k" mode="non-automatic">
Hi guys!<s>
I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the Kitchen, I want to share with you, a treat that I like to call my S'mores cookie cups!<s>
Now, I know they sound really fancy, but they could not be easier and they are like the perfect treat if you love s'mores but you don't want to have a camp fire or have a big elaborate fire outside and all that.<s>
These are easy to make and are absolutely delicious!<s>
The ingredients you'll need are very few and basic - and very simple ones especially if you love to make s'mores, you might already have these ingredients on hand, so let me take you over them to get started!<s>
You'll need some all purpose flour, baking soda, some salt, some ground graham crackers, I've got granulated sugar, brown sugar, some unsalted butter that's really softened at room temperature.<s>
I've got little Hershey's bars, this was just little bars this size that I just cut up into little squares.<s>
And then I have some shredded chocolate which I'll talk about in a minute, an egg, mini marshmallows, and vanilla extract.<s>
And that is it!<s>
Couldn't be any easier.<s>
Now what did - I took a bunch of these little Hershey's bars and I just separated them because I needed like 48 little pieces.<s>
And then I took some - because I need about 1/4 cup of grated chocolate - and I just took a Microplane, you can use your box grater or anything that's not as fine as a zester, and I just grate it just like that.<s>
And I need about a quarter cup so I'll leave the rest as my little treat.<s>
Now, the first thing you want to do is get your oven preheated to 375F, what I have here is a mini muffin tin that I have greased with some non-stick cooking spray, and you want to get that out of the way.<s>
And I'm just going to make everything in my standing mixer just because it makes my life a lot easier!<s>
Now, in this bowl I"m going to add in my butter that's borderline melted because I have had it on the stove while the oven was preheating, so it started to melt a little bit, but that's perfectly fine.<s>
Both kinds of sugar.<s>
And I'm just going to cream them together just so that the sugar is well combined with the butter.<s>
That's looking great!<s>
I am just going to scrape down the paddle attachment and just the side of the bowl - side of the bowl, just because I want to make sure everything is incorporated.<s>
I'm adding in my egg and a good splash of vanilla extract and then I'm just going to mix this together until everything is combined.<s>
Now what I did - I took some graham crackers and I just pulsed them really well in my food processor until it was like a fine powder - that's what I want.<s>
So that's what I have here and I"m just going to take a spoon and mix all my dry ingredients together just to give them a head start.<s>
It doesn't have to be perfect because it's all going to get mixed up anyway.<s>
I'm just going to babysit this and get it to - till it's nice and creamy and then we'll add in our dry ingredients!<s>
Perfect!<s>
Let's give it a little scrape-a-roo.<s>
And now we are just going to add in our dry ingredients.<s>
Very simple, kind of like you are making a chocolate chip cookie, minus the chocolate chips.<s>
I'm just going to add my dry ingredients and the grated chocolate, now you can totally omit the grated chocolate if you want to but it makes a difference!<s>
And why you'd want to skip on chocolate is beyond me - but you can omit it if you want to.<s>
Just going to let this mix until you - until your dough comes together and then we'll be ready to get these babies in the oven!<s>
That is exactly what I am looking for.<s>
It's at the right consistency for moi!<s>
Now, I'm just going to take that out, I love how it comes out really nice and clean and effortless - which I love.<s>
Push this baby out of the way.<s>
And now, you can use a tablespoon, or I'm just going to use an ice cream scoop - my little handy dandy ice cream scoop that's about the size of a tablespoon and I am just going to take that and pop that into each little muffin cup.<s>
And once you have them all scooped out, you just roll them in your hands so that they're sort of into a nice neat ball, and then you put then in your muffin tin.<s>
Now, as you can see, I'm sort of pressing them down.<s>
You can use whatever you want to make an indent.<s>
A rolling pin is not only my nonna's favorite weapon, but it's also multipurpose in the kitchen.<s>
Haha!<s>
The end of this rolling pin just works perfectly for this - and I've made so many different kinds of cookie cups, I make Nutella, I make Oreo, I make pudding cookie cups - you name it!<s>
And if you would like to see them, comment down below.<s>
But this works perfectly, so I just take the end of my rolling pin and I just sort of press it right in the middle and wiggle it around, and you can see it makes the perfect indent.<s>
I'm just going to continue to do that.<s>
All around..<s>
Perfect!<s>
Now, I'm going to pop these babies into my oven that's been preheated to 375F, and they'll be in there for about 7-8 minutes or until the edges start to get a lovely golden brown color and when they come out, I'll show you what to do next.<s>
My little cups were in the oven for about 9 minutes and now when they come out, the middle kind of looks a little bit puffed up, but what you do is you take the end of your rolling pin or your spoon or whatever you're using, and then you just reinforce that indent that we made.<s>
So, we have those done.<s>
These just came out of the oven, now what I've done is I've turned my oven onto broil, because I no longer need my oven on, I need the broiler on.<s>
And I take a little piece of chocolate - this is optional, but you know - I love chocolate.<s>
And then I take a little tiny piece - I usually cut the little square in half - and then I put that in the very bottom of each one.<s>
Okay, now that you have that, you can add a couple of marshmallows into each one.<s>
I'm going to do, probably three or four marshmallows, depending on how many I can fit.<s>
I do like me some marshmallows though, so I'm probably going to try and do 4 in each one.<s>
Some might only be able to do 3 - yeah because they are going to puff up as they bake, so let's just do 3.<s>
I'll behave.<s>
Now, I'm going to pop this under the broiler and just broil them long enough for the top of the marshmallows to look like a light golden brown color, and they do puff up a little bit, only keep them in there for like a minute, keep your eye on them because they can go from perfect to burned in a second!<s>
So, about a minute should do the job, but just keep your eye on them.<s>
They look perfect!<s>
Now you can leave them as-is because you do have the chocolate on the bottom.<s>
But, I mean, well, you know.<s>
I just like a little tiny bit on the top.<s>
Just so that it says the little Hershey logo, that way you can tell it's kind of a s'more.<s>
Once you have your little square of chocolate on top of each one, allow it to sit for about 5 minutes.<s>
What happens is the heat from the marshmallow starts to beautifully melt the chocolate but yet the little piece of chocolate stays in the same shape.<s>
But watch!<s>
I'm going to take one out.<s>
I'll use this one - comes out absolutely beautiful.<s>
Look how beautiful, lightly golden that is.<s>
But watch this.<s>
You see how the chocolate is actually beautifully soft?<s>
Uh huh!<s>
Uh huh!<s>
I know!<s>
But it still looks like a bar of chocolate on top, right?<s>
I mean come on!<s>
Mhmm Mhmm!!<s>
I want you to see the layers.<s>
The chocolate at the bottom, marshmallow, the beautiful chocolate on top.<s>
Just incredible base.<s>
I quit!<s>
I quit!<s>
ha!<s>
I don't quit, I'm only kidding!<s>
These are phenomenal.<s>
Such a cute little twist on a classic s'more.<s>
I would absolutely love for you to recreate this recipe and share a picture with me on instagram, facebook, twitter, whatever you prefer!<s>
Nothing brings me more joy than seeing you recreate the recipe, I hope you have enjoyed spending time with me and I'll tell you what, these will be the star of your next cookout if you make these for dessert.<s>
And the coolest thing about them in my opinion, is that the top - it looks like a bar of chocolate but it's melted and gooey and delicious.<s>
Just do it.<s>
Go to LauraintheKitchen.com to get the recipe, hope you have enjoyed spending time with me and I will see you next time!<s>
Bye bye!<s>

It's totally healthy and very yummy.<s>
If you make savory cakes, try this.<s>
For this recipe you will need:  cooked short-grain rice,  rice vinegar,  optional sesame seeds,  mayonnaise,  canned tuna,  salt, sugar, onion,  pepper, red bell pepper, carrot,  boiled eggs, broccoli, and red cabbage.<s>
First, in a mixing bowl I’m adding 6 ounces of drained canned tuna,  1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion,  and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise.<s>
And mix to combine.<s>
This is for rice cake filling.<s>
And season with pepper.<s>
You can use crab or salmon salad.<s>
If you are vegetarian, how about guacamole?<s>
In 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar,  add 1 tablespoon of sugar  and 1 teaspoon of salt.<s>
And stir to combine.<s>
And pour it into the cooked short-grain rice and fold to mix.<s>
Be careful not to break rice.<s>
I cooked 2 cups of rice today.<s>
And if you want, now mixing in toasted sesame seeds would be great.<s>
Then equally divide the rice in 5.<s>
And add one vegetable in each bowl:  3 tablespoons of finely chopped red bell pepper,  3 tablespoons of finely chopped carrots,  crumbles of 3 boiled egg yolks,  3 tablespoons of finely chopped broccoli,  and 3 tablespoons of finely chopped red cabbage.<s>
I used blanched broccoli, carrot, and red cabbage for better taste, digestion, and color.<s>
And mix well.<s>
For vegetarians, how about yellow bell pepper or yellow pickled radish for yellow rice?<s>
Any other ideas?<s>

Then for a rainbow cup, make a rainbow in a glass.<s>
First, violet.<s>
And I will add tuna salad between layers.<s>
Then green,  yellow,  press down a little with a spoon to make it firm.<s>
orange,  and red.<s>
And for sushi rice cake, make another rainbow in a cup lined with plastic wrap.<s>
This time I started with red.<s>

<transcript id="33" title="Spicy Potato Salad |  Hilah Cooking " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY2w5ho_Pzc" mode="non-automatic">
Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I've got a new variation on potato salad for you.<s>
It's a spicy potato salad, because I posted it on Instagram and a lot of people were like hey, I want to know how to make that.<s>
So, I'm going to show you just in time for the weekend for all of you who are cooking and grilling out some stuff that you're not even inviting me to, you jerks.<s>
Okay.<s>
For the potato salad I've got some potatoes.<s>
They're in the pot.<s>
I already boiled them.<s>
I'm pretty sure you can figure out how to do that.<s>
Meanwhile, we're going to make this dressing.<s>
I've got some mayonnaise in here.<s>
If you don't want to use mayonnaise you can use sour cream.<s>
I'm going to add some apple cider vinegar.<s>
This is one of my favorite vinegars, and I like to get the one that's unpasteurized because it's got a lot of really good probiotics in it.<s>
That means that it's good for your intestines.<s>
A little bit of olive oil and some mustard.<s>
This is a fun little mustard that Suzanne sent me from Germany, and it's got pink peppercorns and green peppercorns in it.<s>
If you can't find this, which I've never seen it in the US so I wouldn't be surprised, you can just use some kind of brown deli mustard.<s>
It would be very similar.<s>
About a tablespoon of that.<s>
Because this is spicy we're going to add some chili powder.<s>
This is just ground New Mexico chili powder without any additional stuff in it.<s>
Good, hefty dose of that.<s>
It's not terribly spicy, but it's got a nice earthy flavor.<s>
Then, for the spice, a little bit of cayenne, and that's optional.<s>
Leave it up to your taste.<s>
That was a few dashes.<s>
Some black pepper.<s>
This has got multiple types of peppers in it.<s>
Super fun.<s>
Some salt.<s>
We'll get this whisked together.<s>
Okay.<s>
We can set that aside and cut up our potatoes.<s>
I boiled some red fingerling potatoes.<s>
That's fingerling, gentlemen.<s>
I'm going to leave the skins on.<s>
You could use some red new potatoes or something like that, too, or some white potatoes.<s>
White, or red, or Yukon gold, those are all really nice for potato salad.<s>
Let's see, maybe cut them lengthwise, just basically bite-size pieces.<s>
It's best to dress the potatoes, mix it up with the dressing while the potatoes are still a little bit warm, because that way they'll absorb more of the flavors from the dressing.<s>
Once the potatoes are in there we've got some celery.<s>
You can cut this up any old size you want to.<s>
I like to cut them lengthwise and then in sort of smallish squares.<s>
Add that to the bowl, then I'm going to add some red onion that I've diced up.<s>
I tried to kind of keep all the vegetables except the celery red.<s>
Get it?<s>
Because spicy, red, devils, cupids.<s>
Okay.<s>
Some fresh red bell pepper.<s>
These are peppadew peppers which look like cherry peppers but they're not really very spicy at all.<s>
They're usually packed in kind of a sweetish brine.<s>
They've got a nice flavor profile.<s>
It's pretty complex.<s>
You can buy them in a jar, or if your grocery store has one of those, like, fancy olive bars they're usually also there.<s>
I've got a couple of those.<s>
You could totally use some cherry peppers instead, although they're going to be hotter than these, so keep that in mind.<s>
Or, sometimes you can even find pickled red jalapenos.<s>
Perfect, that's all in there.<s>
Then, stir it around.<s>
This spoon is ridiculously small for this job.<s>
What am I, an idiot?<s>
Don't answer that.<s>
Here we go.<s>
To me this kind of potato salad with the spiciness and the extra vinegar goes really, really well with grilled meats and barbecue, heavy meats like beef brisket or lamb.<s>
There we go.<s>
There's our spicy potato salad.<s>
If you like this recipe be sure to check out the Greek pasta salad recipe that I just made last week.<s>
Also, check out hilahcooking.com.<s>
You can get this printable recipe, and also I posted a grilled lamb recipe that would be superb alongside this potato salad.<s>
Try that this weekend, send me a picture of what you made, and I will love you forever, with my clothes on.<s>
Did I go out of frame?<s>
Sorry.<s>
That's delicious.<s>
It's tangy and refreshing and spicy, and I love it, and I hope you try it.<s>
I think you're really going to like it.<s>
Thanks so much for watching.<s>

Bye.<s>
