Hi, this is Stephanie Manley with CopyKat.com.<s>
Don't you just love Cracker Barrel's fried apples?<s>
Well, guess what?<s>
I'm going to show you how to make Cracker Barrel's famous fried apples, at home and in your own kitchen.<s>
All right, so I'm just finishing chopping up my apples.<s>
You can make this recipe with about five or six apples.<s>
My recipe calls for either butter or bacon drippings.<s>
Now the Cracker Barrel doesn't use bacon drippings in theirs, but you know what?<s>
This tastes really good with bacon drippings, and that's how my grandma used to do it, so I can testify that that makes them very, very tasty.<s>
This recipe just has a few ingredients in it.<s>
That's about five or six tart apples, some brown sugar, a little bit of nutmeg, some cinnamon and lemon juice.<s>
So after you finish slicing up all of your apples, you want to keep them a nice pretty color, so we are going to add just a little bit of lemon juice to this, and give it a stir before we take this over to the stove and start cooking our fried apples.<s>
Okay, so we're going to get started on our apples.<s>
We're going to take our butter and melt that in the bottom of our skillet.<s>
Again, you can go ahead and use bacon drippings if you happen to have bacon drippings.<s>
It'll taste just as good.<s>
I'm going to let that butter get nice and melted, and next I'm going to add my apples.<s>
I'm just going to pour them evenly on the bottom of my skillet.<s>
I'm cooking these on a medium heat, not too high, and not too low.<s>
I am using an all-clad skillet here, but you know what?<s>
I've seen many chefs use far less expensive skillets, so I think any skillet will really do.<s>
In fact, an iron skillet will be great for this as well.<s>
All right, so my butter is all nice and melted right now, and the apples are just beginning to release some of their juices.<s>
So now we are going to sprinkle in our brown sugar, so we've added in our brown sugar, it's just beginning to melt.<s>
I am going to add in my cinnamon, and I am going to add in a little bit of nutmeg, and I'm just going to stir to incorporate.<s>
These smell just incredible.<s>
Now this butter and brown sugar is going to make a really, nice, thick syrup, so these apples will fry in syrup, and the butter.<s>
It's going to take about 15-20 minutes for these to finish up.<s>
Then we'll come back, when they're all nice and done.<s>
All right, so we're about halfway cooking these apples, and you can see we have this wonderful thick syrup right here.<s>
So while these are cooking, just be sure to stir them every couple minutes.<s>
You're going to have some fabulous fried apples, so now you know how to make Cracker Barrel fried apples, but you know what?<s>
I've got lots more great recipes online at copykat.com, and if you're watching this video on YouTube be sure to like or give the video a thumbs up, and let me know what recipe you would like to see next.<s>
These are my apples, and you can see this wonderfully, creamy, syrupy sauce is all over these apples.<s>
They're nice and soft now and they're going to taste just great!<s>
We're going to give this one a try, so good.<s>
