I'm Natalie Hodson, here today in the bodybuilding.com kitchen showing you how to make a recipe that I make a lot of mornings, and it's my <entity type="Recipe">Blueberry Protein Pancake</entity>.<s>
This is a really good recipe.<s>
If you're getting tired of the same old <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">oats</entity>.<s>
This uses the exact same ingredients.<s>
It just mixes them into a different way.<s>
I know there's a lot of protein pancake recipes out there, but I like this one because it uses all whole foods and it tastes really good.<s>
These are all the ingredients that we're gonna use for today's recipe.<s>
We're gonna use <entity type="Amount">6</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity>, and <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of old fashion <entity type="Ingredient">oats</entity>.<s>
I like the old fashion <entity type="Ingredient">oats</entity> better than the <entity type="Ingredient">instant oats</entity> just because they're a little bit less processed.<s>
The <entity type="Ingredient">instant oats</entity> have actually been cooked and dehydrated to make them cook faster, and these haven't.<s>
They've just been rolled.<s>
We have <entity type="Amount">1/4</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity>.<s>
You can use fresh or frozen or you can substitute it for raspberries or strawberries.<s>
We have <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">unsweetened vanilla almond milk</entity>.<s>
And just make sure that when you get the <entity type="Ingredient">almond milk</entity>, you're getting the unsweetened vanilla kind.<s>
I like the Almond Breeze brand.<s>
It's 40 calories, has no sugar in it.<s>
Also, if you wanted, you could substitute milk, but I prefer the <entity type="Ingredient">almond milk</entity>.<s>
And then we have <entity type="Amount">1</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">baking powder</entity>.<s>
This is just to help the pancakes rise a little bit.<s>
<entity type="Amount">Two</entity> <entity type="Unit">packets</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">Truvia</entity>.<s>
This is to make them a little bit sweeter.<s>
I have <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">unsweetened applesauce</entity> and just <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">dash</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">cinnamon</entity>.<s>
And those two items we're gonna save 'til the end and use it as a topping on top of the pancakes.<s>
So for today's recipe, I'm actually gonna use a blender to mix everything together.<s>
And I'm gonna start with my liquid ingredients.<s>
Gonna pour in my <entity type="Ingredient">almond milk</entity>, and then I'm going to do my <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity>.<s>
And I'm just gonna crack these right into the blender.<s>
Now some people just throw their yolks away into the trash can.<s>
I actually like to put mine in the garbage disposal, and I found that out the hard way.<s>
I used to just throw my yolks into the trash can, and one day I came home and my house smelled really bad and I couldn't figure out why.<s>
And it's because I left the yolks in the trash can for too long, and so now what I do is I'll just put them right into the garbage disposal.<s>
Some people like to feed the egg yolks to their dog, and I guess that helps with their coat and makes it a little bit shinier.<s>
And this is a really good breakfast recipe if you have kids.<s>
I have a 2 year-old and he loves this recipe.<s>
We eat it a couple times a week.<s>
And it's a really good way to incorporate some whole grains into their diet, and the <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity> has some really good antioxidants.<s>
Another thing you can do is you can make these in bulk on the weekend, and then freeze them.<s>
I think they taste a little bit better fresh but you definitely can freeze them.<s>
And when I do that I just put them in a Ziploc bag and then when I wanna eat them, I stick them in the microwave for about a minute.<s>
Alright.<s>
So we have <entity type="Amount">6</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity>.<s>
Then I'm just gonna add my <entity type="Ingredient">oats</entity>.<s>
And I'm gonna save the <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity> until we're actually in the griddle.<s>
I'm gonna add my <entity type="Ingredient">baking powder</entity>.<s>
I'm just gonna do <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">dash</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">salt</entity>.<s>
It's probably about <entity type="Amount">1/8</entity> of a <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> if you were to measure it.<s>
And then <entity type="Amount">two</entity> <entity type="Unit">packets</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">Truvia</entity>.<s>
If you want to eat the pancakes without any applesauce on top, you could add <entity type="Amount">a third</entity> <entity type="Unit">pack</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">Truvia</entity>.<s>
It would make your pancakes sweet so you wouldn't need to add the applesauce on top.<s>
And then I'm just gonna blend this really fast.<s>
Alright.<s>
I'm quickly gonna turn my skillet on to about medium-high heat.<s>
Then I'm just gonna spray it with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray.<s>
And then I'm just gonna take my batter and--this recipe makes two pancakes.<s>
Two pancakes is one serving so usually just kinda eyeball it.<s>
And put about half of the batter in the skillet, and then I'm gonna take <entity type="Amount">half</entity> of my <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity> and just drop them in the top.<s>
You can blend these, the <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity>, in too if you want.<s>
I've done that before, but I think it tastes a little better this way.<s>
Makes them a little bit juicier.<s>
So we're just gonna let this cook.<s>
Usually you can tell they're ready to flip when there's bubbles in the center of the pancake.<s>
So I went ahead and flipped the pancake.<s>
We've been cooking it about 1 to 2 minutes on each side.<s>
And sometimes the first pancake doesn't flip quite as well as the second pancake, and it's because sometimes in the blender the <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity> tend to kinda stay at the top and the oats fall to the bottom, but this one turned out pretty good.<s>
So I'm just gonna take the pancake and put it on my plate.<s>
I'll flip it I guess.<s>
That side's not quite as pretty.<s>
And then I'm gonna go ahead and put my second pancake in.<s>
I'm just gonna blend it for just a second to get everything shaken up.<s>
Gonna spray my pan with the spray.<s>
Then I'm just gonna pour the rest of my batter in.<s>
Make sure to get all those <entity type="Ingredient">oats</entity> out.<s>
And I'm gonna add the rest of my <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity>.<s>
And we're just gonna let it cook about 1 to 2 minutes per side.<s>
You know it's ready to flip once the edges look like they're cooked all the way through and there's bubbles starting to form in the center of the pancake.<s>
Alright.<s>
So we are done cooking our second pancake.<s>
I'm gonna go ahead and put it on the plate.<s>
Oops.<s>
As you can see, this is a lot of food.<s>
This is another reason I like this recipe is 'cause it's really great way to start the day with a nice hearty meal.<s>
And then--the pancakes are really sweet on their own I think, and so a lot of times I'll actually eat these even without any applesauce on top.<s>
You can use <entity type="Ingredient">sugar free syrup</entity> if you want, but I prefer to stay away from that just because it has a lot of preservatives in it.<s>
So sometimes if I want a little extra something on top, I'll use <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">unsweetened applesauce</entity>.<s>
Just make sure you get the <entity type="Ingredient">applesauce</entity> that says no sugar added or unsweetened or if you read the ingredient list, the only ingredients are apples, water, and maybe ascorbic acid which helps keep the coloring.<s>
So I'm just gonna go with this <entity type="Amount">half</entity> of a <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">applesauce</entity>.<s>
I'm just gonna pour it on top.<s>
Sometimes I like to put a little bit underneath.<s>
And then I like <entity type="Ingredient">cinnamon</entity> so I'm gonna put <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">dash</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">cinnamon</entity> on top.<s>
You don't have to do that if you don't like cinnamon.<s>
Sprinkle a little <entity type="Ingredient">cinnamon</entity> on top and there you go.<s>
You have a really good breakfast.<s>
One serving is 2 pancakes, and each serving has <entity type="Amount">6</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">egg whites</entity>, and <entity type="Amount">1/2</entity> a <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">oats</entity>, <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">blueberries</entity>, and <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">almond milk</entity>.<s>
