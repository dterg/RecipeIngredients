Hey, dudes.<s>
I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking, I'm making <entity type="Recipe">Chinese egg rolls</entity>, which might more appropriately be called <entity type="Recipe">Chinese-American egg rolls</entity> because they're a complete bastardization of original <entity type="Recipe">Chinese spring rolls</entity>, I'm sure.<s>
But anyway, these are great for snacks, appetizers, or even Easter because they're called <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
Get it?<s>
That'll really throw your guests for a loop.<s>
They'll be like, 'What the f-- is Chinese food doing here with the <entity type="Ingredient">ham</entity>?<s>
' Okay.<s>
The first thing we're going to do is make our filling.<s>
So, these have a precooked filling that you will cook it, and then cool it before we fill the <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
I'm going to add <entity type="Amount">a</entity> little <entity type="Unit">bit</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity> to my pan and start sauteing.<s>
I've got <entity type="Amount">some</entity> super, very, very finely minced <entity type="Ingredient">celery</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">onion</entity> here.<s>
So, while that's going, I've got also here about <entity type="Amount">a half</entity> a <entity type="Unit">pound</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">ground pork</entity>.<s>
You can use <entity type="Ingredient">ground turkey</entity>, or you can leave out the meat completely and add some more vegetables if you want to also.<s>
I'm going to add to this -- This bowl, I've got <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">brown sugar</entity>, <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">corn starch</entity>, and <entity type="Amount">some</entity> minced <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">ginger</entity>.<s>
So, when you add <entity type="Ingredient">corn starch</entity> to <entity type="Ingredient">ground meat</entity> like this, it kind of helps lock in the moisture.<s>
So the <entity type="Ingredient">meat</entity> doesn't dry out, and it helps it sort of bind together.<s>
So, it's serving two purposes.<s>
I'm just going to mix this in with the <entity type="Ingredient">ground meat</entity> here.<s>
Also going to add about <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">tablespoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">soy sauce</entity> to this and <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">pepper</entity>.<s>
I'm going to use <entity type="Ingredient">white pepper</entity>, but you can use <entity type="Ingredient">black pepper</entity> or <entity type="Ingredient">red pepper</entity> if you want it a little bit spicier, and <entity type="Amount">a</entity> little <entity type="Unit">bit</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">salt</entity> also.<s>
I'm going to add <entity type="Amount">a</entity> little <entity type="Unit">bit</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">salt</entity> to these <entity type="Ingredient">vegetables</entity> too, to draw some of that moisture out, to sweat them a little bit.<s>
They'll soften up a little quicker.<s>
And then, just get our <entity type="Ingredient">meat</entity> mixed up and add that to the skillet also.<s>
Then, we just want to stir it around, break the <entity type="Ingredient">meat</entity> up as much as you can, and eventually, it'll sort of come into really, really tiny little crumbles.<s>
So, keep an eye on that and have a brew while you're waiting, because nothing goes with <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity> like beer.<s>
Right?<s>
You could also have <entity type="Ingredient">water</entity>, but hey.<s>
Look.<s>
Tecate Light.<s>
I'm saving calories on my beer so that I can have more fried <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity> later.<s>
Beautiful.<s>
Okay.<s>
Just a few minutes later, it looks like this.<s>
I'm going to turn the heat off.<s>
You just want to make sure that any big chunks of <entity type="Ingredient">meat</entity> are sort of broken up.<s>
You want, really, a very fine filling for these <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
Then, transfer it to a plate.<s>
You can use a baking sheet or something.<s>
We just want to spread it out so that it cools off faster.<s>
If there's any <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity> left in the bottom of your pan, you can try to keep that behind.<s>
We'll use that to cook the <entity type="Ingredient">cabbage</entity> also.<s>
Okay.<s>
We'll set that aside.<s>
Then, back in the same skillet.<s>
I'm going to add a tiny bit more <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity>, and we'll add the <entity type="Ingredient">cabbage</entity>.<s>
So, this is shredded <entity type="Ingredient">Napa cabbage</entity>.<s>
I just sliced it really, really finely.<s>
You can use regular old green <entity type="Ingredient">cabbage</entity> too.<s>
That'll give you more sort of texture inside your <entity type="Recipe">egg roll</entity>, and that's more common in restaurants.<s>
I don't know.<s>
I had <entity type="Ingredient">Napa cabbage</entity>.<s>
So, I'm using <entity type="Ingredient">Napa cabbage</entity>.<s>
Either one is fine.<s>
You can also add <entity type="Ingredient">bean sprouts</entity> and things like that.<s>
So, we're just going to saute this until the <entity type="Ingredient">cabbage</entity> is wilted.<s>
It shouldn't take very long at all.<s>
Okay.<s>
So, <entity type="Ingredient">cabbage</entity> getting nice and wilted.<s>
We don't want to get it too soft because you want to keep a little bit of texture, and it'll still continue to cook, even after you've turned the heat off.<s>
So, this looks pretty good.<s>
The leafy parts are nice and soft, but the stemmy parts are still a little crispy.<s>
So, I'm going to turn that off, and I'm going to add <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">water chestnuts</entity>.<s>
These is just like -- These is just like-- <entity type="Amount">A</entity> <entity type="Unit">can</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">water chestnuts</entity> that I drained and minced finely.<s>
And then, I'm also going to add <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">mushrooms</entity>.<s>
These are <entity type="Ingredient">dried Shiitake mushrooms</entity> that I've just had soaking in <entity type="Ingredient">water</entity> for about an hour.<s>
<entity type="Ingredient">Wood ear mushrooms</entity> are, like those black ones that are really firm, are also commonly used in <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
These are a little bit easier to find, usually.<s>
So, squeeze the water out.<s>
Then, I'm just going to mince up these <entity type="Ingredient">mushrooms</entity> too.<s>
And then, finally to this, I'm going to add <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">tablespoon</entity> of regular, <entity type="Ingredient">all purpose flour</entity> and mix that in.<s>
That's just going to help the filling stay kind of firm.<s>
As it cools, it'll thicken it up.<s>
So, it'll sort of make a mass that you can form into little <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
I'm going to spread this out on top of the meat mix.<s>
Then, we'll just put this whole thing in the fridge and let it get super chilled.<s>
You can make the filling a day ahead of time, even two days ahead of time, which is muy excelente when you've had a lot of brews.<s>
Okay.<s>
Time to roll these mofos.<s>
This is just about half the mixture.<s>
It's cooled off totally.<s>
These are my <entity type="Ingredient">egg roll wrappers</entity>.<s>
You can find these in the frozen section, usually, of pretty much any major grocery store.<s>
You just want to thaw them out, and then keep the rest of them covered while you're rolling them so they don't dry out.<s>
It dries out pretty quickly.<s>
So, there's two here.<s>
God damn it.<s>
They stick together.<s>
Stick together like a hand in glove.<s>
These <entity type="Ingredient">egg roll wrappers</entity> are the best of friends.<s>
Okay.<s>
It's going on my album, guys.<s>
Stay tuned.<s>
Stay iTuned.<s>
Just kidding.<s>
Okay.<s>
So, you want to get a big spoonful, maybe like a quarter cup or so of your mixture.<s>
Put it pretty much right in the center, maybe a little bit below the center, but pretty much just right on, bros. And then, roll the bottom up.<s>
What I like to do is kind of take it over, and then pull it back.<s>
Did you see how I did that?<s>
Did you see how I did that?<s>
So that it gets a nice little tight log.<s>
Fold this side over.<s>
Fold this side over.<s>
Then, in this little bowl, I've got just a mixture of plain <entity type="Ingredient">flour</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">water</entity>, about equal parts, maybe a little bit more <entity type="Ingredient">water</entity>.<s>
It's not important really.<s>
Just use your finger to go.<s>
I like to sort of get these sides here, like the envelope sides, and then the little point also.<s>
This is going to kind of glue it together.<s>
Then, just roll it over like that.<s>
Just like that.<s>
Make sure that you have enough in that little tippy tip.<s>
There we go.<s>
So then, we want to set this aside, seam side down on a plate.<s>
You can make these and let them sit for maybe, like, ten or 15 minutes tops.<s>
But eventually, and pretty quickly, the filling, the liquid in the filling and the <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity> in the filling is going to kind of soak through the wrapper.<s>
So, you can't really make them really ahead of time.<s>
But like I said, you can make the filling ahead of time.<s>
Then, just roll up a few.<s>
Then, as you're frying the first batch, you or someone else, ideally you have a little helper, a little kitchen elf, will be rolling the next batch.<s>
So, it's kind of a fun thing to do if you have friends that like to cook, to have them over, and let's all make <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity> together.<s>
You can make some different fillings.<s>
You can put <entity type="Ingredient">shrimp</entity> in them, or you could make vegetarian ones.<s>
You could put <entity type="Ingredient">carrots</entity> in them.<s>
You could put whatever in them.<s>
Good.<s>
So, I'm going to roll up about six of these while I start heating up my <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity>.<s>
I've got some <entity type="Ingredient">peanut oil</entity> in the skillet, just three-quarters of an inch or so, to about 365 degrees Fahrenheit.<s>
Catch you on the flip side.<s>
Wait.<s>
There we go.<s>
Cowabunga.<s>
Once your <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity> is around 365, you want to carefully fry your <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity> in small batches for one to two minutes on each side, until golden brown.<s>
Now, we're talking.<s>
Be careful not to fry too many at once because the temperature will drop, and you'll end up with greasy <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
You'll also run the risk of over boiling your <entity type="Ingredient">oil</entity>.<s>
Drain your <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
Then, I like to put them in a bowl that's lined with a paper towel, sort of upright, so that the excess oil can drip off.<s>
They actually stay pretty warm this way.<s>
<entity type="Recipe">Egg rolls</entity> are done.<s>
What time is it?<s>
It's <entity type="Recipe">egg roll</entity> time.<s>
What time is it?<s>
It's time for <entity type="Recipe">egg rolls</entity>.<s>
Those don't rhyme.<s>
So, I've got here <entity type="Amount">some</entity> oriental hot <entity type="Ingredient">mustard powder</entity>.<s>
You can find this in spice areas.<s>
Daisy, quit being such a bitch.<s>
You just mix up the <entity type="Ingredient">powder</entity> with <entity type="Ingredient">water</entity> to the desired consistency.<s>
I like mine a little bit thin so that it's good for dipping.<s>
Then, I've also got some <entity type="Ingredient">sweet chili sauce</entity>.<s>
So, if you like this <entity type="Recipe">egg roll</entity> recipe, also check out my chimichangas for another delicious fried treat with a Mexican twist.<s>
I also did fresh spring rolls recipe a couple years ago that aren't fried, and they're way healthier and almost as delicious.<s>
With that said, let's give this a taste.<s>
I like this hot <entity type="Ingredient">mustard</entity>.<s>
It's going to clear out my allergies.<s>
It's a fine crunchy <entity type="Recipe">egg roll</entity>.<s>
There you go.<s>
