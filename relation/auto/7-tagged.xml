many Italian island today on highly cooking or making McDonald knock-off full efficient watch this is alway better than McDonalds range and and I'm gonna tell you if the most are the hot guy and then it and here's a hint have to do to Jesus pass well home that way to start out dour anything fish anything to Lafayette try to get like as big ever fully as you can anything said sorta firm will do well I caliber a cod and we're just gonna try to cut it into square ash shape so that it looks a little bit like down the nets and half way back saffir this little interesting shaped thing here sorry kind of starting to split their summers gonna go ahead and cut it diamono and then trim of like the little pointy and bet just cannot trust squared off a lover and you can still awake you know cook these in in them when I like fissionable or something but and they want gonna say much because they're not perfect so then these lines are cut in half these ones coming on mommy so ashamed to have my language there right now I'm bad grammar so they're not exactly square but they're rectangular and thats a type a square guys than others but the memorable here all the little pieces same army to tiny and then squeeze San oranges over awesome said skin like brighten up the flavor a little bit we're just not this marinated in lemon juice for about 10 minutes in that time we can make our McDonald's Corp of tartar sauce to make sure our little fishies get covered you don't have one man you could use are a little bit like white wine <B-Ingredient>vinegar</B-Ingredient> something arson tarragon vinegar would make it a fancy French filet of fish Philip French not be something else entirely okay I'm and get set up and will make aren't her shots while we wait on us man obviously tires are starts with a man is based now if you would like a more fancy time to turn it off I have a recipe for one with parsley and capers and Carl Icahn others other shit on a website if you want to do that but this is what I think is closest to the McDonalds tartar sauce which really just can t spectacles said is at <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>pinch</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>man</I-Ingredient> and a woman in white paper this is my own fancy attach sure it's not the real thing but it has trended and then to make it McDonald the this is just some diced up like hamburger dole fleiss's just mentioned really tiny in a adding a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of that pickle juice in there champ so down plaid and down there and then some super min step why and as well just like the 10-year you can chop it better I'm a magician with a knife you could use a food processor if you have bad skills and with nixon something that argument to the devil oh that reminds me so the story have the flatfish as the sky in Ohio that had franchise when McDonald's for stars franchising he was making any money during Lent because his a really eighty-nine percent catholic or something so he like all that wanna mcdonnell himself and he was like looked on sorry I mean rhyme I'm not making any money over here in Ohio and make a fish sandwich data for an abrupt route I was like I don't think so buddy then he tasted it and he was like wow this is the best sandwich ever not better than my hamburgers but you have my permission to put it on your menu and centers restaurant and then it went nationwide like the next year cell there you go time to read the donuts I mean the fish I mean don't okay so I drained the lemon juice of I've the fish fillets and down and some now because no alcohol something and as your body good just enough to cover too many wasted how drink that later my passion so just get them all in a rather hang out time and then for the breading part what I dan is a mashed up some moisture crackers here until they're very very fine these ROIs to crackers they taste like saltines but they look like or stirs I don't know either con that but that's a good enough reason I think I like to use these one i'm reading stuff instead of saltines because one there cheaper than saltines by like a few sense but I am NOT free will beeotch and also they're already in tiny pieces so they break up faster so I did was puts on them into this little the tough baggy and Krishna until they're fairly fine most of them are powder ash and a min ago but add <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of plain dry bread crumbs to that to you if you want to just use breadcrumbs that's fine but I felt like the crackers kinda gives it and better coming cell just like that together and thus the crackers are you have <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> on into the night nanny salts and esters it's enough not salt with just what's on the crackers 10 hours new standard <B-Ingredient>milk</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>crackers</I-Ingredient> not crackers plate the there okay ac if fishing areas and I want their coated you want them in the fridge for at least 10 minutes up to two or three hour she can make you had had a little bit and that's going to help that cutting it here said on Friday doesn't just like fall off into that trying well Easter so I'll see that tenants to fry the fish and got just under about a half inch <B-Ingredient>peanut</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient> here you

throw in a little read crime like this just across and saw lights not not peeing that sizzling sound and will are fleas and and you remember when I I'm cut them out I ended up with two that were a little bit thicker and tuner little bit then are so the thicker ones honest they're gonna take a little bit longer Kirk cell math come easier sometimes just to do them together to thank you once again there and then if anyone's that basically we just got cookies for I met on the far side and Phil be nice golden brown what mother doing under two minutes or so on a second time until that's going around by then inside should be perfectly cooked and you to fall off and flaky and mores like a fish sandwich here we go cell just check out the second plane usually brown slower than the first sessy still prepay of felt like them but maybe another minute or so if you wanted to make the lower-fat you can also totally thank them just to the breading ass spray it with a little better you know spray or something and bake it on it like a tray with iraq like this by many as the spring training but you can just take it on here at 4:15 for about 15 minutes it's not going to get like as selectively
