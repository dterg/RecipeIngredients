Hi, I'm Eugenie.<s>
Today I'm making <entity type="Recipe">watermelon cookies</entity>.<s>
Those cookies are really easier than you think and it takes only several everyday ingredients.<s>
It's basically a French biscuit sable recipe which is a slightly modified version of my French coffee sables.<s>
First, in a mixing bowl, I will add in <entity type="Amount">½</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of softened <entity type="Ingredient">unsalted butter</entity>  and <entity type="Amount">1/3</entity> <entity type="Unit">cup</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">granulated sugar</entity>.<s>
And whisk until light and fluffy.<s>
And add in <entity type="Amount">1</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">egg yolk</entity>.<s>
Remaining <entity type="Ingredient">egg white</entity> will be used later.<s>
And add in <entity type="Amount">½</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">pure vanilla extract</entity> and <entity type="Amount">a</entity> generous <entity type="Unit">pinch</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">salt</entity>.<s>
And whisk until homogenous.<s>
Now sift in <entity type="Amount">1 and ¼</entity> <entity type="Unit">cups</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">all-purpose flour</entity> and fold until combined.<s>
Now divide the batter into half.<s>
First I will make red dough by adding <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">red food color</entity> and kneading.<s>
This method is called 'fraiser' and you can mix without making the dough too tough with this method.<s>
And make a 2 inch diameter cylinder and cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.<s>
Then take out half of the remaining vanilla dough and cover with plastic wrap.<s>
Then roll out.<s>
And chill in the refrigerator.<s>
And with the remaining dough make a green dough.<s>
Today I'm using both <entity type="Ingredient">matcha</entity>, <entity type="Ingredient">Japanese green tea powder</entity>, and <entity type="Ingredient">green food color</entity>.<s>
And again I will knead until homogenous and cover with plastic wrap.<s>
Then roll out.<s>
And chill in the refrigerator.<s>
Now bring red dough and vanilla dough to working surface.<s>
Measure the size of the red cylinder and cut out the sides of the vanilla dough  and roll out to lengthen it.<s>
And place the red cylinder over it and carefully roll up like a yoga mat.<s>
Now cut off the surplus vanilla dough.<s>
Repeat with the green.<s>
By the way the cookie dough should be cooled a little before rolling, otherwise the dough will be too soft and won't hold the shape well.<s>
Now cover the dough with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.<s>
Now make a colored sugar.<s>
In a plastic bag, add in <entity type="Amount">a</entity> little <entity type="Unit">bit</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">green food color</entity> and spread with fingers to avoid any green color lumps.<s>
And add in <entity type="Ingredient">sugar</entity> and mix well until homogenous.<s>
This is a simple way to make colored sugar at home.<s>
And make a sugar bed.<s>
Then break <entity type="Amount">one</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">egg white</entity> and brush on the cookie dough.<s>
And roll the dough over sugar bed.<s>
French sable cookies need sugar decoration.<s>
And slice the dough half inch thick.<s>
And arrange the disks on a cookie pan.<s>
And decorate with <entity type="Ingredient">toasted black sesame seeds</entity>.<s>
I love the mixed flavor of <entity type="Ingredient">green tea</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">sesame seeds</entity>.<s>
But if you don't have <entity type="Ingredient">sesame seeds</entity>, use <entity type="Ingredient">mini chocolate chips</entity>.<s>
Again I will chill the pan in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes  and then bake in the oven preheated to 350 degrees F. (175 C) for about 10-12 minutes.<s>
Out of oven immediately cut the cookies in half and let cool for 5 minutes.<s>
Then transfer to a wire rack.<s>
Voila!<s>
<entity type="Recipe">Watermelon cookies</entity>.<s>
They are so so cute!<s>
I love them.<s>
It's French sable cookie style, so there are little cracks.<s>
Bon appetit.<s>
My dad really like sable cookies and I also love those crumbly biscuit sables!<s>
