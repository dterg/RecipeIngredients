[music] [music] Hi, I'm Christine Avanti, celebrity nutritionist and chef.<s>
Today I'm going to be teaching you how to make my world-famous 10-minute tacos.<s>
But before I get started, I just want to give you a rundown on what the ingredients are.<s>
So very simple, we're starting out with some grilled <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>breast</I-Ingredient>, okay?<s>
I'm going to be topping my tacos with <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> shredded lettuce, <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>salsa</B-Ingredient>.<s>
I'm gonna use <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>beans</I-Ingredient> and low-fat shredded cheese and just as a side, I've got <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>brown</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>rice</I-Ingredient>, okay?<s>
We also are using white <B-Ingredient>corn</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>tortillas</I-Ingredient>.<s>
I love these guys.<s>
I'm gonna garnish with <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> fresh <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient> and <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>cilantro</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Mmm, so good, I love it.<s>
And a little bit of avocado, a right?<s>
Are you guys ready?<s>
I'm hungry so I'm gonna get started.<s>
All right, so we're gonna start with <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>olive</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient>, just a teeny bit, just for some cooking, get that chicken cooked up.<s>
I've got my pan on medium high.<s>
Just gonna let that heat up for a second.<s>
Every good chef loves to season with <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> and <B-Ingredient>pepper</B-Ingredient>, and I know people are afraid of <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> but I'm not afraid of <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient>.<s>
I eat healthy all the time.<s>
I exercise a lot so salt is not going to kill me or my clients.<s>
If you have high blood pressure, then that's a different story.<s>
So we've got <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> in there always gonna go with the base, fresh-cracked pepper.<s>
This chicken breast--see, my husband seems to like this and guys really like this.<s>
This is pre-made, store-bought, cut up <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>breast</I-Ingredient>.<s>
I'm not the hugest fan of that but if you're in a hurry, it's good just to buy <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>breast</I-Ingredient> already cut up and made.<s>
You can buy it at the grocery store, Trader Joe's, wherever.<s>
So I'm gonna put my <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient> in here.<s>
It's about <B-Amount>4</B-Amount> <B-Unit>ounces</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>breast</I-Ingredient>.<s>
Okay.<s>
That's 4 ounces.<s>
Let me wash my hand really quick.<s>
I'm sorry, guys, but you can't cross contaminate.<s>
Sorry.<s>
So when you touch meat, you always want to wash your hands with hot, soapy water because cross contamination can be a problem in the kitchen.<s>
I'm gonna season.<s>
Instead of using the packet of taco seasoning that's high in sodium and preservatives, I'm gonna use some fresh <B-Ingredient>spices</B-Ingredient>, just <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>paprika</B-Ingredient>, just sprinkling.<s>
You don't have to get out a measuring spoon.<s>
This is <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>chili</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> and it's gonna start to smoke, which I love.<s>
<B-Amount>Some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>cayenne</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>pepper</I-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> crushed <B-Ingredient>red</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>pepper</I-Ingredient> and <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>cumin</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Cumin is a spice that you will see a lot in Spanish and Latin cooking.<s>
We're smoking, whoo, hoo, hoo.<s>
Okay.<s>
Literally because this is pre-made <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>breast</I-Ingredient>, I'm just gonna look it for just like a minute, just to get the spices on it.<s>
And also when you heat a spice, that lets the flavor release so kind of fun, kind of cool.<s>
Smells good.<s>
And I think that this chicken breast looks prettier with the spices on it.<s>
All right, so I'm turning off my heat.<s>
I'm moving my pan over.<s>
Let that cool off.<s>
The spices are making me cough.<s>
I'm sorry.<s>
It's how it happens.<s>
Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get my <B-Ingredient>tortillas</B-Ingredient> ready.<s>
Now if you have a gas range at home, you just turn on your heat, kind of to low, throw the tortilla right over it.<s>
You don't spray, you don't do anything.<s>
Just put the tortilla right over it.<s>
If you don't have a gas stove at home and you have an electric stove, that little like coil-looking thing, heating element, as they call it, you can put it on that too, medium high, just make sure that it's clean and it's not like coated with like sticky like Cream of Wheat from yesterday or something.<s>
And you just leave it on there and then I hope every healthy cook at home as a set of tongs because if you don't, you need to go by some.<s>
They're like a dollar at Target, okay?<s>
Go get yourself some tongs because you're gonna use those to flip over your <B-Ingredient>tortillas</B-Ingredient>.<s>
You use them for a lot of things, but for this meal, it's for tortillas.<s>
Just get some fire on the--look at how pretty that is.<s>
Just like a Martha Stewart photo at the end of the day when I'm done with these.<s>
We'll make them so pretty that Martha will be proud.<s>
Okay, they're almost done.<s>
And you know what?<s>
If you don't have--if you don't feel like heating them on your heating element, on your stove, on your gas range, you can always just microwave them.<s>
I'm not a big fan of the microwave but last case scenario--worst case scenario, go ahead and throw them on there.<s>
This one looks like it's literally on fire, which is fine.<s>
Okay, so I'm turning all the burners off.<s>
And I'm going to very quickly cut up my avocado 'cause that's gonna go into my taco.<s>
And I just want to cut a lime 'cause we want a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>juice</I-Ingredient> once we're ready to build the taco here.<s>
And then I'm just gonna cut a tiny bit of <B-Ingredient>cilantro</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Chop it up real quick so we've got that.<s>
Now, these tacos, it's not super hot.<s>
I can hold it with my hand.<s>
It's no big deal.<s>
I'm gonna take my chicken--look at this <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient>.<s>
It's gorgeous, a lot better-looking than that chicken I had before, right?<s>
Put it in there.<s>
Okay, it's a little hot.<s>
Ow.<s>
Okay, cool off, cool off, cool off.<s>
I'm gonna put a little bit of--I'll put <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>rice</B-Ingredient> in here.<s>
I'm put <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>beans</I-Ingredient>.<s>
It's kind of hot.<s>
Hold on, you guys.<s>
Wow.<s>
I think I might have grabbed it too soon.<s>
Okay, so mental note, don't grab the <B-Ingredient>tortillas</B-Ingredient> straight off of the stove, give it a second to cool off.<s>
I mean I'm not completely burning to where I need to go to the emergency room but I'm burnt.<s>
It hurts.<s>
Okay, so there I'm gonna put a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of fresh lettuce.<s>
I'm gonna put a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of fresh <B-Ingredient>cheese</B-Ingredient>.<s>
How pretty is that?<s>
There's one taco.<s>
I wasn't lying when I said 10 minutes, kids.<s>
Ten minutes.<s>
Okay, put this bad boy on here.<s>
More of my--hey, Mr. Avocado, I know you wanted to go for a ride, but I'll use you in a minute.<s>
Okay, more <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Again, look at this chicken compared to straight from the store, okay?<s>
We got some quick here.<s>
We kicked it up a notch.<s>
Thanks, Emeril.<s>
Okay, and I just touched <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient>.<s>
All right, sorry.<s>
Washing my hands.<s>
Okay, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>rice</B-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>beans</I-Ingredient>.<s>
It's not a ton, but, you know, it's enough.<s>
Some people like their cheese right up against the warm parts.<s>
We can do it this one like that, put the cheese right there, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of lettuce, some avocado slices.<s>
And I've got <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>salsa</B-Ingredient> as well so we can put <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>salsa</B-Ingredient> on there when we're done.<s>
Give it a little bit of <B-Ingredient>cilantro</B-Ingredient>, little squeeze of <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Simple.<s>
We'll make our last taco.<s>
This tortilla was really hot so I was giving it a few minutes to cool off.<s>
I think we're there.<s>
It feels good to me.<s>
Last little bit of <B-Ingredient>chicken</B-Ingredient>.<s>
If you guys don't have spices at your house, like cumin, <B-Ingredient>cayenne</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>pepper</I-Ingredient>, <B-Ingredient>paprika</B-Ingredient>, <B-Ingredient>chili</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient>, you should go get some because it really makes food taste good, okay?<s>
It makes food taste phenomenal and I think that we--not only do we like good-tasting food but, as humans, we eat with our eyes so we want the food to look pretty as well.<s>
And just because it's healthy, does not mean it has to look bland and not fun, okay?<s>
Little bit of <B-Ingredient>cilantro</B-Ingredient>.<s>
I'll do my <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient> again, yummy, yummy, yummy.<s>
Who wouldn't want to eat these?<s>
That's what I want to know.<s>
I'm gonna eat them.<s>
So we've got three tacos, little tacos.<s>
I mean these <B-Ingredient>tortillas</B-Ingredient> were pretty small.<s>
They weren't that big.<s>
You get a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>extra</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>brown rice</I-Ingredient> on the side for a little bit more carb.<s>
These tacos are only about 10 to 12 grams of carbohydrate per tortilla, so that's why we're adding a little bit more <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>beans</I-Ingredient> and <B-Ingredient>brown</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>rice</I-Ingredient> to it.<s>
You can put your <B-Ingredient>salsa</B-Ingredient> there on the plate for just prettiness.<s>
And did we already give it lime?<s>
I'm gonna give it a little bit more <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient>.<s>
We love lime.<s>
Lime definitely helps the flavor and we're gonna put some more avocado.<s>
Here's the great thing about this meal, avocado is loaded with what we call mono and saturated fatty acids.<s>
These mono and saturated fatty acids are good fats.<s>
They've been clinically shown in several studies, one particular a Yale study, that actually helped reduce belly fat by 33% in people who were dieting.<s>
Another study showed that mono and saturated fatty acids that come from avocado, our dear friend the avocado right there, were actually people who were eating the more of these good fats from avocado were losing more weight than other dieters that were eating the same amount of calories.<s>
So it's not only about calories in versus calories out.<s>
It's about what are your calories?<s>
Are you eating good fats?<s>
Are you eating lean proteins?<s>
Are you eating processed food?<s>
If you're gonna eat a processed meal that's 400 calories versus a meal made of real food that's 400 calories.<s>
Trust me, the real food meal is gonna help your body get filter and leaner faster than anything else.<s>
So I'm putting all my avocado on here.<s>
Put a little bit on our <B-Ingredient>rice</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Who says you can't have avocado on rice, right?<s>
Little bit more <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>beans</I-Ingredient>.<s>
I like to mix up my <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>beans</I-Ingredient> with my <B-Ingredient>rice</B-Ingredient>.<s>
I just think it's more exciting and more fun.<s>
And here you go.<s>
You've got my 10-minute tacos, 377 calories for this entire plate, 20 grams of protein, 50 grams of carbs.<s>
You're good to go.<s>
All right, I'm Christine Avanti.<s>
