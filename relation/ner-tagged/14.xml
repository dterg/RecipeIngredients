[music] I'm Natalie Hodson, and I'm here in the bodybuilding.com kitchen today, showing you how to make one of my favorite side dish recipes and I call it <entity type="Recipe">Death-by-Garlic Roasted Asparagus</entity>.<s>
And it's a really good side dish to go with chicken or tilapia and it even works great as leftovers.<s>
I put it in a Ziploc bag and use it the next day.<s>
For today's recipe, this is a pretty simple recipe though we only use a few ingredients and I have everything here.<s>
We are going to use fresh <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> and use about <entity type="Amount">1</entity> <entity type="Unit">pound</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity>.<s>
They usually come in bundles like this.<s>
And <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is a little bit more thin and <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is a little bit thicker and it doesn't really matter, you can use either.<s>
We're gonna use fresh <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> and <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> does come pre-minced but I prefer the fresh <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity>.<s>
I think it makes the recipe taste a little bit better so we're gonna just buy the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic clove</entity> like this.<s>
And then we are going to use <entity type="Ingredient">garlic powder</entity> and just make sure that you get the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic powder</entity> and not the garlic salt.<s>
They look real similar.<s>
They come in the same size of container but the garlic salt has quite a bit of salt added to it and the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic powder</entity> is just straight garlic.<s>
And then we are going to use <entity type="Ingredient">extra virgin olive oil</entity> and we're just gonna use <entity type="Amount">1</entity> <entity type="Unit">tablespoon</entity> of this, so just <entity type="Amount">a</entity> little <entity type="Unit">bit</entity>.<s>
And then <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">pepper</entity> and I have fresh ground pepper but you could--if you don't have the fresh ground, just regular <entity type="Ingredient">black pepper</entity> will work as well.<s>
And then we're gonna bake everything on a cookie sheet and line it with aluminum foil and I already went ahead and pre-heated my oven to 400 degrees.<s>
So the first thing we're gonna do is line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.<s>
And this just makes for easier cleanup so that way, when you're done, all you have to do is take your aluminum foil out, throw it in the trash and it's really easy to clean up.<s>
Okay.<s>
So then we're just gonna set this aside.<s>
First, we just take our <entity type="Unit">bunch</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity>, take off the rubber bands and then just rinse this, make sure that gets nice and rinsed and then what I do is I like to keep the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> still in the bunch formation and you want to cut off the bottom about inch of the stalk and--because the bottom of the stalk is really tough and it doesn't taste good, it's not fun to chew.<s>
So what I do is I just take a kitchen knife and I just cut it all at once so it's really fast and easy.<s>
And you just cut off the bottom of the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> and then what you're gonna do is evenly distribute the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> over the cookie sheet.<s>
The next step is mincing the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity>.<s>
So <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity>, when it comes in a clove, has an outer shell kind of like an onion and so what I usually do is just cut the end off just so it's easier to peel and then there's some stuff, I just throw that away and then there's--if you can see inside, there's a lot of little what are called <entity type="Ingredient">garlic cloves</entity>, so you just take out--this recipe calls for anywhere from <entity type="Amount">four to six</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">garlic cloves</entity> and it just depends on how much <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> you like.<s>
I usually--I like <entity type="Amount">a lot</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> so I err on the side of <entity type="Amount">six</entity> but if you don't like <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> as much or as strong, then you could just do <entity type="Amount">four</entity>.<s>
And another thing too, if you don't like garlic, you could actually make this recipe even without the garlic and just use salt and pepper and it would still taste pretty good.<s>
All right.<s>
So I'm just gonna set this aside and we have <entity type="Amount">six</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">garlic cloves</entity> here.<s>
Now these still have kind of an outer papery shell on them.<s>
And so you need to take that off.<s>
So what you do is you just put the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic clove</entity> flat on your cutting board, take a knife that has kind of a wider flat edge and you just go like this and you just hit it and what it does is it kind of crushes your <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> so it makes it really easy to pull but it actually, I found out, this one has two cloves inside of it so I'm gonna do that again.<s>
And then it makes it really easy just to peel off the outer shell.<s>
So I'm just gonna do this for all six.<s>
I really like--I eat <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> a lot.<s>
I really like eating <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> and one thing that a lot of people don't know is that <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is actually really high in folate and a lot of pregnant women are recommended to take folic acid which is the supplemental form of folate and so <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is really good for pregnant women too.<s>
And <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is also a natural diuretic so if you feel like you're holding on to some water weight or if you're feeling kind of bloated, sometimes eating <entity type="Amount">some</entity> <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> can help your body rid itself of some of that water.<s>
All right.<s>
So your hands are gonna feel kind of sticky when you're doing this.<s>
That's okay, that's normal.<s>
One, two, three, four, five.<s>
All right.<s>
So since that original clove actually was two cloves inside of it, I'm gonna set one of them to the side.<s>
And then I just throw all the paper stuff away.<s>
Sometimes it sticks to your hand a little bit.<s>
I just rinse my fingers.<s>
All right.<s>
So we're gonna mince the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> really finely and I'm just gonna do that with a knife.<s>
We already took the outer shell off, the papery part, and I just put my hand on the top and I kind of bunch it together and then I just mince it like this and I just keep pressure on the top of the knife and I just kind of keep going back and forth and then what I do is bunch it back together and just keep mincing, just like this.<s>
And you just want it really pretty finely minced because you don't want anybody to take <entity type="Amount">a</entity> big old <entity type="Unit">chunk</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity>.<s>
They might not appreciate you for that.<s>
So this is looking pretty good.<s>
I would say that's about as finely minced as you want.<s>
So I'm going to rinse my hands.<s>
And then I'm gonna set this aside for a second.<s>
And then what we're gonna do is put the <entity type="Ingredient">olive oil</entity> on.<s>
So I just use <entity type="Amount">1</entity> <entity type="Unit">tablespoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">olive oil</entity>.<s>
Now this recipe makes four servings and so each serving is gonna have less than <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity> of <entity type="Ingredient">olive oil</entity>.<s>
So I do--I like to measure it out because sometimes I have a tendency to use too much <entity type="Ingredient">olive oil</entity> so I just like to measure it out that way and know I'm just using a tablespoon.<s>
And I just slowly drizzle it over.<s>
Just like this.<s>
And then what I'll do is I'll take either a spatula or even just the measuring spoon and I'll just sort of go like this just to make sure that the <entity type="Ingredient">olive oil</entity> doesn't get wasted on the bottom of the cookie sheet and that it gets over all the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity>.<s>
So then what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic powder</entity> so if you have thicker stalks you might not need quite as much <entity type="Ingredient">garlic powder</entity>, but if you have more stalks, you might need a little bit more, if you have thinner stalks.<s>
So I just sprinkle--this is 1 teaspoon and that didn't even cover half of it so I'm gonna do it again, 3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon.<s>
So just gonna keep sprinkling and it looks like I'm gonna use the whole tablespoon for this recipe 'cause remember this is called <entity type="Recipe">Death-by-Garlic Asparagus</entity> so it's gonna be pretty heavy on the garlic.<s>
And if you don't like <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity>, again, you can use lighter <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> or even no garlic and just use <entity type="Ingredient">salt</entity> and <entity type="Ingredient">pepper</entity>.<s>
And then I'm gonna use some fresh ground <entity type="Ingredient">pepper</entity> and this, I just kind of eyeball it.<s>
You could probably use about <entity type="Amount">a</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoon</entity>, maybe <entity type="Amount">2</entity> <entity type="Unit">teaspoons</entity> and if you don't have the fresh ground, just regular <entity type="Ingredient">black pepper</entity> will work.<s>
And if you wanted to add some salt, you can, but I usually just don't add extra salt.<s>
And then what I'm going to do is take my knife and kind of scoop the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> onto the knife and then just evenly distribute this over the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity>.<s>
So I just take my finger and I just go like this.<s>
Now if you were to eat a raw garlic clove, your eyes would probably water up and your mouth would probably start to burn because it's really spicy but when you roast it like we're gonna do on 400 degrees, it kind of takes some of the spiciness out of the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> and it makes it have more of the garlic flavor that we're used to.<s>
So that's it.<s>
All I'm gonna do is rinse my hands and then stick this in the oven at 400 degrees and I'm gonna cook it for 15 to 20 minutes.<s>
So what I'm going to do is put this in the oven, set the timer for 10 minutes.<s>
At 10 minutes, I'm gonna take a spatula and just kind of rotate the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> a little bit to make sure that one side doesn't get burnt or crispy and then I'm gonna put it back in the oven anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.<s>
And if it starts to look too brown, then I'll pull it out at 5 minutes.<s>
Usually I cook it for the full 20 minutes.<s>
All right.<s>
So we just took the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> out of the oven.<s>
At 10 minutes, we checked the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity>, just rotate it, make sure it wasn't burning and then at 15 minutes we checked it again and what I like to look for is to make sure that the <entity type="Ingredient">garlic</entity> starts to kind of turn brown a little bit and actually at 15 minutes ours looked good so you can cook it 15 and up to 20 minutes but we took ours out at 15 minutes.<s>
And then what I do is I just use my spatula and put the <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> onto a plate.<s>
Just like that.<s>
And this <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is a little bit thinner which is probably why we were able to take it out at 15 minutes too.<s>
If your <entity type="Ingredient">asparagus</entity> is a little bit thicker, you'll probably want to go closer towards the 20-minute mark.<s>
And this looks really good.<s>
I'm gonna clean up this super easy.<s>
All I do is fold up the aluminum foil, throw it in the trash and this looks really good so I'm gonna try it.<s>
And you can serve this warm or you can serve it chilled as well.<s>
Tastes really good.<s>
