[music] I'm Natalie Hodson, and I'm here today in the bodybuilding.com kitchen, showing you how to make one of my favorite recipes.<s>
It's a strawberry <B-Ingredient>banana</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oatmeal protein bake</I-Ingredient>.<s>
And I like to make this sort of as a healthier version of <B-Ingredient>banana</B-Ingredient> bread so if I'm craving banana bread but I know it's not very healthy for me, I'll make this instead.<s>
And it's also a really good meal that you can make on the weekends.<s>
You can make it in bulk and you can keep it in your 'fridge during the week or you can also freeze it so if you have to get out the door really quickly in the morning, this is a great item you can eat for your breakfast meal.<s>
So for today's recipe, these are the ingredients that we're going to use.<s>
And we have dry ingredients and wet ingredients that we're gonna mix separately.<s>
So for our dry ingredients, we have <B-Amount>2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>cups</B-Unit> of old-fashioned <B-Ingredient>oats</B-Ingredient> and I prefer the <B-Ingredient>old-fashioned</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oats</I-Ingredient> to the <B-Ingredient>instant</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oats</I-Ingredient> just because they've been a little bit less processed.<s>
The <B-Ingredient>instant</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oats</I-Ingredient> have actually been flattened, cooked and dehydrated and so the old-fashioned oats have just been rolled and they're a little bit better for you.<s>
And then we have <B-Amount>4</B-Amount> <B-Unit>scoops</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>vanilla</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whey protein powder</I-Ingredient>.<s>
You can use any brand you prefer, just keep in mind that the different brands will make it taste slightly different.<s>
We have <B-Amount>2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>tablespoons</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>ground</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>flax seed</I-Ingredient> and this is actually optional but flax seed has--is full of omega 3 fatty acids and they help reduce the LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol, and it's full of fiber and antioxidants so it just makes the recipe a little bit healthier.<s>
And when you buy the <B-Ingredient>flax</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>seed</I-Ingredient>, it comes in a bag like this, it's already ground, and you usually can find that in usually in the baking aisle of your grocery store by the other flours and things like that.<s>
Then we have <B-Amount>1</B-Amount> <B-Unit>tablespoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>ground</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>cinnamon</I-Ingredient>.<s>
We have <B-Amount>1</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>fourth</B-Unit> of <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> and that's just to help the <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> rise.<s>
And then we have <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <I-Amount>1/2</I-Amount> <B-Unit>cup</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>Stevia</B-Ingredient> in the Raw.<s>
And that's what I used for this recipe.<s>
If you had <B-Ingredient>Truvia</B-Ingredient> or <B-Ingredient>Xylitol</B-Ingredient>, you can use that as well.<s>
And then for our wet ingredients, I have a 1/2 <B-Unit>cup</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>unsweetened</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>applesauce</I-Ingredient> which is also 4 ounces.<s>
This is the kind I got.<s>
When you get your <B-Ingredient>applesauce</B-Ingredient>, you just want to make sure that you get one that says no sugar added or <B-Ingredient>natural</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>applesauce</I-Ingredient> and the most important thing you can do is read the ingredients list so try to find one that the only ingredients are apples and water and maybe ascorbic acid and that's just vitamin C to help keep the <B-Ingredient>applesauce</B-Ingredient> from turning brown.<s>
And sometimes I even--what I'll do is I get the little Mott's containers that are for kids and that way it's like the perfect serving size and I have those in my cupboard for my son anyways and I'll use those sometimes.<s>
So that's a 1/2 a cup and then we have <B-Amount>1-1/2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>cups</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>unsweetened</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>vanilla almond milk</I-Ingredient>.<s>
And I like to use <B-Ingredient>almond</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>milk</I-Ingredient> in my recipes instead of <B-Ingredient>milk</B-Ingredient> because it's lower in calories and it has less sugar.<s>
And this is the kind I like.<s>
I like the Almond Breeze brand, <B-Ingredient>unsweetened</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>vanilla almond milk</I-Ingredient>.<s>
It only has 40 calories.<s>
Just be careful when you're buying your <B-Ingredient>almond</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>milk</I-Ingredient> because some of the flavors add quite <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>sugar</B-Ingredient> so, again, just read the ingredient list and make sure that--like, this one has 0 grams of sugar in it.<s>
And then we're gonna use a fourth of a <B-Unit>cup</B-Unit> of plain <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient> and this is the <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient> that we have today.<s>
Just, again, make sure that you're getting the non-fat plain <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient>.<s>
Make sure you don't get one that's vanilla flavored or any other flavor because they're gonna add <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <I-Amount>lot</I-Amount> of <B-Ingredient>sugar</B-Ingredient>.<s>
If you look at the back, it might have anywhere from 5 to 8 grams of <B-Ingredient>sugar</B-Ingredient> and those are the sugars that naturally occur in lactose so.<s>
And then we're gonna use <B-Amount>four</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient>.<s>
I have my whole <B-Ingredient>eggs</B-Ingredient> here.<s>
We'll crack them when we make the recipe.<s>
And I have <B-Amount>two</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient>.<s>
We're gonna slice these really thin and then we have four or five strawberries and you want to get big strawberries.<s>
If they're kind of small then you can go five or even six.<s>
And those are all the ingredients we're gonna use today in our recipe.<s>
All right.<s>
So first what we're gonna do is mix all of our dry ingredients together in a bowl.<s>
So you're gonna take a larger mixing bowl and you want to put the dry ingredients in a larger mixing bowl because later we're gonna mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.<s>
So just put your wet ingredients aside for a second and then we're gonna mix <B-Amount>2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>cups</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>oats</B-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>4</B-Amount> <B-Unit>scoops</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>protein</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient>, our <B-Ingredient>flax</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>seed</I-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>1</B-Amount> <B-Unit>tablespoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>cinnamon</B-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>1/2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>cup</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>Stevia</B-Ingredient> in the Raw, <B-Amount>1</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> and a fourth of <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient>.<s>
And then I'm gonna take my whisk and just make sure everything gets mixed together really well.<s>
Sometimes I have gotten lazy and not mixed it together very well and my <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> doesn't evenly distribute and then when it cooks, half of it kind of is flatter than the rest.<s>
So you just--you want to make sure that the cinnamon taste gets evenly distributed and the <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient>.<s>
And just until you can't see any more, you know, brown spots or white spots, just until it looks nice and mixed.<s>
So this looks pretty good.<s>
So we're just gonna set this to the side and then mix together our wet ingredients.<s>
And it doesn't really matter what order.<s>
We're gonna take our <B-Ingredient>almond</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>milk</I-Ingredient>.<s>
Put that to the side.<s>
Our <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient>.<s>
And the <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient> just adds some moisture to the recipe and actually in any recipe you can substitute <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient> or <B-Ingredient>applesauce</B-Ingredient> for the <B-Ingredient>butter</B-Ingredient> and the <B-Ingredient>oil</B-Ingredient> in the recipe.<s>
So now we're gonna put in our <B-Ingredient>applesauce</B-Ingredient> and just make sure you use a rubber spatula to get it all out.<s>
And then we're gonna put in our <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient>.<s>
Now a little trick that I learned.<s>
I used to just throw my <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> in the trash can and for some reason, I could not figure out why, my house smelled bad all the time.<s>
And then one day I went to go take out the trash and it was gross.<s>
I could tell <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient>--or <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yolks</I-Ingredient> were seeping through the bottom of the trash bag.<s>
And my--we've realized that it was because I was eating so many <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> and I was throwing so many <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yolks</I-Ingredient> in the trash can and so now I just throw them in the garbage disposal so that way it doesn't stink up our house.<s>
I know some people who have dogs actually let their dogs eat the <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yolks</I-Ingredient> and it's good for their coats but we don't have any pets so I just do the garbage disposal.<s>
There you go.<s>
And last one.<s>
You also could do the liquid <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> if you wanted that come in a carton.<s>
Just make sure you use a little bit less than the ratio calls for when you bake.<s>
And then I'm gonna take my--whoops--I'm gonna take my whisk and just mix this all together really well.<s>
Sometimes the <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> can kind of stick together a little bit so just mix it until it looks nice and mixed.<s>
Then we're gonna bring over my mixed dry ingredients and we're just going to combine these.<s>
And then stir it all together.<s>
I have a 2-year-old and this is his favorite part.<s>
I let him usually do this while I'm cutting up the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> or sometimes I'll let him cut the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> with me.<s>
It's kind of fun to get the kids involved with this recipe.<s>
It's also a really healthy meal that you could get your kids to get some whole grains into their diet.<s>
All right.<s>
So now that that's mixed, we're gonna prepare our pan.<s>
Let's move this to the side.<s>
And we're just gonna use an 8-inch pie pan.<s>
You could use a 9-inch pie pan as well and if you don't have pie pans you could even just use a square casserole dish.<s>
And then just really lightly spray that.<s>
You don't want to use a lot of this stuff but I just use the non-stick cooking spray.<s>
And then just take your cutting board and we're gonna take one of our <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> and we're just gonna slice it really thin.<s>
So take your knife and you just do pretty thin slices because you want enough banana slices that you can layer the entire bottom of the pan.<s>
Now sometimes <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> turn color after they've been exposed to the air.<s>
And so I don't always but sometimes I've made this dish before and if I let it sit in the 'fridge for a couple of days, it kind of turns almost a purplish color so if that happens to you don't be alarmed.<s>
That's not--there's nothing wrong with it.<s>
It's just because the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient>, once they get exposed to the air, they can change color.<s>
So now what I'm doing, is I'm just taking the <B-Ingredient>banana</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>slices</I-Ingredient> and lining the bottom of the pan.<s>
And after I'm done lining this, then we're gonna pour the batter on top of the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient>.<s>
So this way, when you bite into it, you have banana taste on the bottom and then we're gonna put another layer of <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> on the top.<s>
All right.<s>
So this looks pretty good.<s>
Now what we're gonna do is pour the batter on top of the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient>.<s>
And you just evenly distribute it there.<s>
It's gonna fill the pan up all the way to the edge.<s>
And then just scrape out the rest.<s>
All right.<s>
And then what we're going to do is slice our second <B-Ingredient>banana</B-Ingredient> and we're gonna do the same thing so we're gonna put a nice layer of <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> on the top and not only does this make it taste good, but it also makes the dish really pretty.<s>
So the thinner you slice your <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient>, the more you're gonna be able to put across the pan.<s>
All right.<s>
And this recipe makes four servings so one serving really just has one egg white, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>scoop</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>protein</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> and 1/2 a <B-Unit>cup</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>oats</B-Ingredient> plus a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient>, a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>almond</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>milk</I-Ingredient>.<s>
It does have half of a banana and <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little bit of <B-Ingredient>spices</B-Ingredient>.<s>
So this is a really good option for breakfast and if you are kind of getting tired of just regular old <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> and <B-Ingredient>oatmeal</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Okay.<s>
So I didn't distribute this very evenly so I'm gonna try and scoot some of these <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> over.<s>
That looks pretty good.<s>
Then what I'm gonna do is take my <B-Ingredient>strawberries</B-Ingredient> and again, I'm gonna slice these fairly thin.<s>
And you don't have to add the strawberries if you don't, you know, if you don't have them, you can just do the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient>.<s>
The nice thing about this recipe is it's really versatile so you really could use any kind of fruit.<s>
I've done this before with <B-Ingredient>peaches</B-Ingredient> and that was pretty good.<s>
I've done it with <B-Ingredient>blackberries</B-Ingredient>.<s>
You could do it with <B-Ingredient>apples</B-Ingredient>.<s>
You could do it with raspberries, really whatever fruit's on sale that week, you could do it with.<s>
Raspberries would be really good.<s>
And then I just put the strawberries on top like that and I did four--I did four strawberries or five strawberries and just so it looks about like that.<s>
So that's it.<s>
We have the oven.<s>
I already preheated the oven to 375 degrees.<s>
So I'm gonna stick this in the oven and we are going to cook it for about 40 to 45 minutes.<s>
Basically the top is gonna get golden brown and you know it's done once you put a knife in the center and the knife comes out clean.<s>
All right.<s>
So I just took this out of the oven.<s>
We cooked it for 45 minutes and I'm just gonna test it to make sure that a knife comes out clean.<s>
It looks pretty good.<s>
And as you can see, the top of this is gonna be kind of a golden brown color and what I'm gonna do is let it sit here and rest for between 5 to 10 minutes just until it cools.<s>
If I tried to cut into it now, it would all sort of collapse together.<s>
So we're gonna let it cool and set for about 5 to 10 minutes and then after that I will cut it into fourths.<s>
One serving is one wedge.<s>
So I just usually just use a <B-Ingredient>butter</B-Ingredient> knife and cut through.<s>
And then sometimes I like to take my knife and run it along the side just in case--just so it doesn't stick.<s>
Right.<s>
Then I'm just gonna take a serving utensil and pull out one wedge and there you go.<s>
So what I might do is cut it in half again or just eat it like that so this looks really good.<s>
I'm gonna try a bite and see how it tastes.<s>
It tastes really, really good.<s>
I think you'll be surprised.<s>
This is one of my favorite dishes.<s>
