Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I've got a new variation on potato salad for you.<s>
It's a spicy potato salad, because I posted it on Instagram and a lot of people were like hey, I want to know how to make that.<s>
So, I'm going to show you just in time for the weekend for all of you who are cooking and grilling out some stuff that you're not even inviting me to, you jerks.<s>
Okay.<s>
For the potato salad I've got <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient>.<s>
They're in the pot.<s>
I already boiled them.<s>
I'm pretty sure you can figure out how to do that.<s>
Meanwhile, we're going to make this dressing.<s>
I've got <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>mayonnaise</B-Ingredient> in here.<s>
If you don't want to use <B-Ingredient>mayonnaise</B-Ingredient> you can use <B-Ingredient>sour</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>cream</I-Ingredient>.<s>
I'm going to add <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>apple</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>cider vinegar</I-Ingredient>.<s>
This is one of my favorite vinegars, and I like to get the one that's unpasteurized because it's got a lot of really good probiotics in it.<s>
That means that it's good for your intestines.<s>
A little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>olive</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient> and <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>mustard</B-Ingredient>.<s>
This is a fun little mustard that Suzanne sent me from Germany, and it's got pink peppercorns and green peppercorns in it.<s>
If you can't find this, which I've never seen it in the US so I wouldn't be surprised, you can just use some kind of <B-Ingredient>brown</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>deli mustard</I-Ingredient>.<s>
It would be very similar.<s>
About <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>tablespoon</B-Unit> of that.<s>
Because this is spicy we're going to add <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>chili</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient>.<s>
This is just ground New Mexico <B-Ingredient>chili</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> without any additional stuff in it.<s>
Good, hefty dose of that.<s>
It's not terribly spicy, but it's got a nice earthy flavor.<s>
Then, for the spice, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of cayenne, and that's optional.<s>
Leave it up to your taste.<s>
That was a few dashes.<s>
Some <B-Ingredient>black</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>pepper</I-Ingredient>.<s>
This has got multiple types of <B-Ingredient>peppers</B-Ingredient> in it.<s>
Super fun.<s>
Some <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient>.<s>
We'll get this whisked together.<s>
Okay.<s>
We can set that aside and cut up our <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient>.<s>
I boiled some red fingerling <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient>.<s>
That's fingerling, gentlemen.<s>
I'm going to leave the skins on.<s>
You could use <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>red</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>new potatoes</I-Ingredient> or something like that, too, or <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>white</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>potatoes</I-Ingredient>.<s>
White, or red, or Yukon gold, those are all really nice for potato salad.<s>
Let's see, maybe cut them lengthwise, just basically bite-size pieces.<s>
It's best to dress the <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient>, mix it up with the dressing while the <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient> are still a little bit warm, because that way they'll absorb more of the flavors from the dressing.<s>
Once the <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient> are in there we've got <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>celery</B-Ingredient>.<s>
You can cut this up any old size you want to.<s>
I like to cut them lengthwise and then in sort of smallish squares.<s>
Add that to the bowl, then I'm going to add <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>red</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>onion</I-Ingredient> that I've diced up.<s>
I tried to kind of keep all the vegetables except the <B-Ingredient>celery</B-Ingredient> red.<s>
Get it?<s>
Because spicy, red, devils, cupids.<s>
Okay.<s>
Some fresh red bell <B-Ingredient>pepper</B-Ingredient>.<s>
These are peppadew peppers which look like cherry <B-Ingredient>peppers</B-Ingredient> but they're not really very spicy at all.<s>
They're usually packed in kind of a sweetish brine.<s>
They've got a nice flavor profile.<s>
It's pretty complex.<s>
You can buy them in a jar, or if your grocery store has one of those, like, fancy olive bars they're usually also there.<s>
I've got <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <I-Amount>couple</I-Amount> of those.<s>
You could totally use <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>cherry</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>peppers</I-Ingredient> instead, although they're going to be hotter than these, so keep that in mind.<s>
Or, sometimes you can even find pickled red jalapenos.<s>
Perfect, that's all in there.<s>
Then, stir it around.<s>
This spoon is ridiculously small for this job.<s>
What am I, an idiot?<s>
Don't answer that.<s>
Here we go.<s>
To me this kind of potato salad with the spiciness and the <B-Ingredient>extra</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>vinegar</I-Ingredient> goes really, really well with grilled meats and barbecue, heavy meats like <B-Ingredient>beef</B-Ingredient> brisket or lamb.<s>
There we go.<s>
There's our spicy potato salad.<s>
