i'm natalie haasan and i'm here nobody will not come kitchen today showing you how to me for my favorite fighters rescue and i call it def by garlic roasted asparagus and it's really good side is sick overtaken or tilapia he and it even works great as leftovers i put it in a ziploc bag in you that the next day for today's recipe this is a pretty simple recipe there really is a few ingredients in i have everything here we are going to use fresh asparagus and news about one count of asparagus the usually come in bundles like this and some asparagus is little bit more thin and some asparagus is a little bit thicker and it doesn't really matter you can use either for any is fresh garlic inc some growth does come pre minutes but i prefer the fresh for like i think me first pt little bit better so organized by the garlic clove like this and then we are going to use garlic powder and just make sure that you get the garlic powder and not the garlic salt they look real somewhere they come in the same sizeof container but the garlic father quite a bit if l added to it in the ground cutters just straight garlic and then we are going to use extra virgin olive oil and risking you want people to know that some just a little bit and then sun paper and i have fresh ground pepper but you could if you don't have the fresh ground just regular black pepper will work as well and then we're going to take everything on a cookie sheet in line with aluminum foil and i really wanna head in preheated the oven to 400 degrees so the first thing your gonna do is line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and this just makes for easier cleanup so that way when you're done all you have to do is take your woman file out thrown in the trash in its really easy to clean up swimmers can set this aside first we just take our bench for spare guess take off the rubber bands and then strength of make sure that gets nice and rinsed and then when i view as i like to keep the spare guess still in punt formation and you want to cut off the bottom about into the stock and because the bottom-up stock is really tough and it it doesn't he's got its not fund issue so what i view as i just take a kitchen knife and i just cut all at once thats really fast and easy of he's cut off the bottom love the asparagus and then what you gonna do is evenly distribute the asparagus over the could be /c men except is mincing the garlic so garlic when it comes to clothes has an outer shell kinda like an anion and so what i usually do is just cut the end of 2003 easier to peel and then there's some stuff i just throw that away and then there's if you can see inside there's a lot of little water call girl close see just take out this recipe calls for anywhere from four to six garlic cloves it just depends on how much curly q like i usually i like a lot acrylic so i air on the fighter sex but if you don't like i like as much or as strong thing you could do stand for and and nothing to if you don't like garlic unit actually make this recipe even without the girl i can just use on paper no it's not it's pretty are sums gonna 5 and we have six garlic cloves here now they still have kinda outer paper resell on them and so you take that off so what you do is you just put the garlic clove far you're cutting board take a knife has kinda wider flat edge you just like this we just headed when it does the concussions your garlic salt makes a really easy to pull open actually found out the phone has to close and find a bit so i unity again and then it makes it really easy just a few of the out urself so i'm just gonna do this for all six i really like i need a fair guess a lot i really like eating asparagus and one thing a lot of people don't know is that asparagus is actually really high in foley and a lot of pregnant women are recommended to take folic acid which is the supplemental form fully and suspect this is really good for pregnant women to and asparagus is also a natural diuretic so if you feel like you're holding on to some water waiter for fun kinda bloated sometimes even some asparagus can help your body red itself from the water so your hands are gonna feel kinda sick you when you're doing this that's okay that's normal persons since that original club actually was to close in saidapet that one of them to fine man i just for all the papers that way sometimes it fixed your hand a little bit print my fingers right so we're gonna miss the garlic really finally and i'm just gonna do that with a knife we already took the outer shell of the people report and i just put my hand on the top and the kinda fun shit together and i just min fit like this they just keep pressure on the top of the knife and i just kind of keep going back and forth and then what i do isn't it back together in just keep keep me in things like that in you just want really pretty finely minced because you don't want anybody to take a big old chunk a garlic they might not appreciate you for a this is looking pretty good i would say that if about is finely minced easy one so i'm going to prince william missed and then i'm gonna set this aside for second and then we're gonna do is put olive oil on so i think is one tablespoon of olive oil now this recipe makes 4 servings and so each serving is going to have less than a teaspoon of olive oil so i do i want to measure it out because sometimes i have a tendency to use too much olive oil so i just like to measure now that we know i'm just using a tablespoon and i just slowly drizzle it over just like this and then i'll do is i'll take either spatula or even just measuring spoon and i'll just sort of go like this tooth just to texture that were olive oil doesn't get wasted on the bottom of the cookie sheet and then it its overall the affair so then we're gonna do is we're going to take for garlic powder so if you have thicker stocks you may not be quite as much garlic powder term but if you have more stocks you might need a little bit more if senator stocks so i just sprinkle this is one teaspoon and that even cover half its i'm gonna do it again three teaspoons eagles 1 tablespoon cell scan keep sprinkling it looks like an ease the full table stand for this because remember this is called death by karl eikenberry if free pretty heavy on your garlic if you don't like i like again you can use lighter garlic or even know garlic is the salt pepper and then i i'm many some fresh ground pepper and this i just kinda i felt like a family is about a teaspoon maybe teaspoons if you don't have the fresh ground its regular black performer if you want to add some salt you can buy i usually just don't add extra salt and then what i'm going to do is take my ninth lincoln sq the garlic onto the knife and then just evenly distribute this over the asparagus so i just take my finger in a just like this now if you're the eap raw garlic clove you're either prolly water up in your mouth but really start to burn because it's really spicy but when your upset like we're going to on 400 degrees critic's summer the spiciness add the garlic and it makes it have more the garlic flavor that reissue so that's it i'm gonna do is rinsed my hands and insects and other than at 400 degrees and i'm gonna cook it for 15 to 20 minutes so what i'm going to do is put this in irvine set the timer for 10 minutes at 10 minutes and take a spatula in just gonna rotate the the asparagus a little bit to make sure that once i doesn't get for a crispy and then i'm gonna put it back in the oven anywhere from five to ten minutes and if it starts to look to brown then applied at five minutes usually i cook it for the full 20 min rock ok alright so we just take the s various other lovin at 10 minutes we take this very guess just wrote it make sure wasn't burning and then at fifteen minutes we checked again and what i like to look for is to make sure that the girl xr6 can turn brown a little bit an actual 15 minutes ours looks good so you can cook at 15 and up to 20 minutes so we take our a fifteen-minute and than what i do is a test is my satchel and the asparagus fun to play asparagus is a little bit senator which is probably why we were able to take out 50 minutes to there's burgers is a little bit thicker you probably want to go closer towards 20-minute mark in this looks really good and clean up a super easy idea of for aluminum foil third in the trash in this looks really good so i'm gonna try it and you can serve this warm or a conservative elders law has really good you can find the full recipe on the page below
