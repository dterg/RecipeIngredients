i'm natalie happen here nobody will not come kitchen showing you how to make frozen spinach cap this is a really easy orbited a recipe is this to thicken high protein shakes and it's great because we put in a protein shake you really can't even taste it now just turn your protein shake screen so if you have an issue with the color protein shake and you can if you will very to it turns that purple and then you don't see the green color and spirits is a cream dark green leafy vegetable which is really good it's high in vitamin a&e an israeli high in iron and calcium as well so for the ingredients for denny's today we're going to use pennants in usually up by between a 6-3 eight-ounce bag different brands have different sizes that they sound but just one bag of spinach and then water and here have two cups of water in your we may not use the full two cups were gonna do is add the spinach in philly at the water until for consistency that we need and then you're gonna need a blender and then we're going to use a muffin tin pan as well he and what we're gonna do you want to go and everything together we're gonna pour the like went into the muffin tin pan and then free that way so this just feels really simple all you do is you put your spin into the blender and i just take and falls in and put it in and you're gonna start by filling about almost all the way for and then my rule of thumb is about half a cup of water per two handfuls of spinach so and i just kinda pour the water in there it looks like we use about 1 cup so we'll start with and then slowly add water and mountains and then you just put the lid on your lender can be kinda loud rights as you can see it really plans down quite a bit and so but i'm gonna do 
is actually at some worse than its you're gonna have their s first then it's in here and then we're just gonna keep lending it i'm i don't think i need to add more water i'm just gonna kinda blender if it gets too thick you basically want it to pick a liquid consistency maybe a little bit think you're not quite as thick as a milkshake consistency me i think this looks pretty good basically you swimming crown fine enough they don't have big chance with minutes and then what ideas i take this and i just poor right into my mouth and 10 and the i usually fill these pretty much all the way for because what i do is and i'll show you later as i just use one each my protein shakes so it looks like this: made about six and so we could double this if we wanted and may 12 and freeze all 12 but today i think we're just gonna make of 6 i'm gonna stick this in the freezer and then just let it freeze for about three hours you can even leave it in there for longer a few our home after three hours and then we're gonna puppies out pulling the plug back east to keep them in the freezer to use for are protein shakes later in the week so i just took the spanish cuts out of the freezer they've been in the freezer for about three hours and as you can tell they're rock-solid so you can you want two things you can't just let them sit on the counter for few minutes until their melted a little bit and you can pop them out or what i like to do it a little bit faster as i'm just going around the bottom of the pan and any some hot water me like to see the threat in than what i like to do is just to take a butter knife and obviously when i can use all 60 the spanish cup in a protein shake it once and so i just take the plot fact i thought usually three or four the spanish cups and has a point back and i saw them in the freezer for that way later when i gotta make a protein shake i can describe a one-out astley's these when i make smoothies fruit smoothies for me two-year-old it's one of the few ways i can get him to next call's so i'm just gonna pop the spanish cup out of that's what it looks like and go ahead a little bit messy but can just read your hands when you're done of 43 in a bag terms i tried to fit too many in there in and the cat to vet i up i'm gonna just for two in this bag and we're gonna save one to use in a protein shake today to make the protein shake i like to use unsweetened almond milk 'it's come with the no i just make sure you get the one that has 35 or 40 calories and rethinking gradient last because some almond milk for do add sugar you wanna make sure unsweetened kind without any sector if you have on now if you could also use water or regular milk i usually use about eight ounces or so i just kinda by paula and then means you 1 skills love whey protein you can use you can you finish up with any flavor and brand and then sensitive ice i'm going to use my frozen spinach company what it's gonna do is it's gonna take a nap the shape and also add from good vitamins vitamin e kelsey ann has complained that up it looks pretty good i'm just gonna portent my cup so it doesn't remember shake a green-collar and if i can wear you out you can have some blueberry service and then it turns the purple and actually my son won't drink some of their green but if they have some blueberries in the turns and purple then he has no clue in hearing from just fine fell he's like a protein shake you can even taste the spinach out of fell for this tip and for all my other recipes check the link below and also continue to visit by billy not calm for nutritional information and motivation tips
