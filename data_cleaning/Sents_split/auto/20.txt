non-stick spray to nine by 13 and I also preheat the oven to 350 degrees so this is easy because it's all in one large bowls the first week that two caps a flower and again no flowers just ground-up ok me on and you can buy it at the store in that how the section you can make your down by grinding and and coffee grinder or I in a blender sam skinner that in 2 cups and I've got to skip 708 protein you can use any flavor that you like for me I just like for this year ingredients the better because then it's health you usually it takes a little better to use it to skip to that and then ima start putting in all their free rein ingredients I've got 2 teaspoons have cinnamon teaspoon and a half as ground ginger half a teaspoon of cloves closer pretty strong but I think that's really what gives a six-player so this guy at teaspoon as at baking soda and a teaspoon and baking powder and a half a teaspoon at Salt for my sweet air I'm actually adding and a half cup others out of you can use the brown sugar plan you can use the regular I actually like the brown sugar plans for this must be a lot but you can always find it this means just the regular have kept as I'll it also that in in except he's trying greens really well hey an end to this gonna start adding the wet ingredients you can make these in separate bowls you like but it's really not necessary some skin put it all right in the same for some I'm gonna start with for egg whites you can use the liquid egg whites if you like I used and regular real eggs can I like those better for me for baking but it's up to you nah man had half a cap on you can use whatever kind you want you can directly or not he can do right now whenever you'd like that I like on oxo have kept at an end to that man had 14 ounce as that ABC applesauce

expression a little bit if you read about adding too much that your dessert he actually don't have to mix them and you can put it all together and just maybe sprinkle half on one side or and just lightly sprinkling on top I like to mix my name because I like a City nets in every bank it's totally up to you speak any getting there maybe a little smaller 8 noticed and fees and now the defense
