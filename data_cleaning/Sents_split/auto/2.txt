make sure that they're not being over the next and then the plate but to leave it at the tire that the first thing you wanna do of course the up in preheated 350 in a couple 9-inch baking pans or cake pans whatever you call them lined with parchment paper and spread them well with some non-stick spray those are ready and waiting and now I'm doing and just taking my spatula and want to make everything from the bottom up gorgeous that'd and I'm gonna take my a white come to happen time and make that in there this is gonna be just be you to follow and and hope the cake why season mister stunning is gonna make that wanted all makes you want divide your batter email lean towards even you can manage among your people can weekly okay now these are gonna going to make preheat oven to 350 for about 30 to 35 minutes on Tyler fully cooked and then we go into making the butter cream which if you love like wedding cake frosting that about agree with it is just a the a dream act opposite I cakes baked for about 30 minutes now let them cool completely on a wire rack and I've done with one of them they don't they're not cute don't because remember we didn't add the egg yolks we just have worked at the end white and fall the best comic the pavlova most but where did I put on a cake stand and then I just for a few pieces parchment paper around taught that the cake then top doesn't get dirty ones I go ahead of day when make it really simple buttercream and I'm really couldn't be easier the first thing to do as you need to start with paraffin softened at room temperature like that it's so so crucial you absolutely need to be at proper speech so to have here a good amount of butter because again this is parked free making this is my standing mixer because it easier it is to with with for a long time so gonna pop that and just add some vanilla extract about tablespoon a bit that is a vanilla buttercream after all and I'm scale what this up until it just the butter such got no get selling have some concessions here from holmdale for this highlighting this year okay lol so happy are they failed to mention is just a small pinch of salt because it all perfection show you what I know is a lot but it is a buttercream and just me Adelaide also out to cut all the sweetness it really does it's a great balance understand add me sugar trying to not get it all over the place I think it's a pretty well a/c well and then just a splash of milk only couple tablespoons milk and now I'm going to get this %uh and get it going and mixing in this could take up 10 minutes I mean buttercream goes from St Sep crumbly for perfection the EQ have patience and by hand do you feel it so it makes life a lot easier go let companies all-girl perfect here backed is perfection it took a good four-minute mixing but I mean look at that I so fluffy so worth the wait so quite there yet again it's really rich but I promise you this is that once in awhile tree typical wedding cake you don't hear very often the most the time frothing is the wedding cake are prepping so just gonna mix have again immense pleasure because the buttercream because if you make buttercream at home that you know the consistency that you looking for sell there's just something about it I just give me great pleasure so this is completely done and now will be going on frosting and its political little bit a
