but ok you i'm do hi and amy and i'm inviting really not come today to show you how i make my turkey meatloaf muffins any large offer this got a lot to make set okay but the nice thing is just one big ball for everything can the first ingredient for the needy is cat a quick cooking oats dozen many that all these ingredients that you mix in with it if that 2 tablespoons of garlic now you can use the patter version or you can use and the minced version ass a way got over here here's the minced garlic now this one seems to be okay if you read the ingredients this is carly water is a spa spark acid and no preservatives this is ok could probably use this as an option and that someone be really careful read the the label they actually have oil and it won't be no prominent won't say on the top so you gotta really check out that is ingredients this is actually rare to be justin waters that's an option to you that we use the powder since just get that way k then we've got high 1 teaspoon salt cactus teaspoons pepper black pepper we've also got teaspoons a a dry mustard just right yellow plastic and sometimes if you're looking for trailer mustard and some people will not be able to find it your standard like dark like this one you will have to find its whateva box looks a little bit more like pepper but it's a start oxo i've noticed it's hard to find sometimes and that's why and then we've got 1 teaspoon as i'm sorry this happened he said have kumon communism a really smoky spice chile get free a lot the spices rent accidents so they really get to you if you're not using a lot of spices in it he said start doing so and then we also have a half teaspoon i have time time is used a lot in all traditions ready you're making chicken turkey year and then our last ingredient is the one that makes the whole dish so this is not the easiest to find so tonight take a little while but its very well worth it this 2 teaspoons if it's holy pepper seasoning i'm serious see find it here's what it looks like so hopefully you'll be able to find and it does add some see so be careful if you're not be on hot things the only add teeth in half or something like that but i really think it without it there lil one plan c definitely want to see said that's it's so i'm skinnies my fingers in kinda get all perforated spath this whole recipe is pretty much about using your hands sound 3 tell it's pretty good on before i really get messy come in and take this off pesticide alright the next thing we need is going to be chopped onions and chopped celery now this is very convenient to just come in a package in your produce section i'm all about quick and easy so this is what i'm gonna do i hate of indians cell nah and if you were to chop it i hear what can i wanted to you i'm above everything so quite a bit you really can't overdo the vegetables in a few nice and a celery can use red peppers green peppers anything you want and that celery in enhancing to work really well finished but the more veggies you add the more moisture there's going to be in your day she stuff so overdo the veggies instead under help texas i'm frighten the next thing you're gonna need is me crappy service here for this recipe you can either use i'm extra lean ground turkey are you can use extra lean ground chicken breast army either one will work really well actually even be four work to yourself and open something and i'm using probably i would say this is about time i have high tops you pound me something and it doesn't have to be exact that's the great thing about this restful as you can and do it all the taste and just dump it all and seem to get so then the next thing you need to add some moisture is good three egg whites if you're not concerned about adding any added fat you can actually do a whole egg in their bit for this purpose for going to just used a rights eg to you eg three now before i really get me in there and get dirty i'm gonna make sure first i have my mustn't hand pets and i've artie said the event 375 degrees so make sure you preheat it's ready to go before you and millions of alright so we're gonna prep this because i don't have to stop in the middle is keeping fingers do it so i'm going to use i'm my no lo or olive oil spray and this is 12 muffin tins should make about 12 and sometimes it goes all over it just depends on how big or small i make them k nice frame good to make sure they don't stay and save my pain because i hate when they get gross i always always always white excess of top cuz they will get pretty gritty if you start making these a lot which is what i do because i always have these on hand in mine for trade or just ready to go cash to keep this recipe completely frozen in your in your freezer just take them out one at a time in my career in front see alright so that's really gonna set that aside bring this back in get busy south take any jury of this quite very starting to look pretty grody which is exactly what we want need don't wanna over makes me too too much and you doing to make sure you get all the spices incorporated and left it up to you know that stuff outta there and if you over makes me tho it tends to get a little more tasks so don't go crazy skit all in and the nice thing about this dish to you is that the muffin tins are what keep it in its a serving size so it's all nice and portable that way and it's got your car and your protein are next in line now is a low amount of carbs so you could still eat them into pda kid and at issue rice cakes or something to them return my foot that i'm still seeing spices some makin sure re: don't over mix of stuff there all right now we're gonna put them enormous in 10 and i think he'd do about a racquetball size see that might be a little larger than a racquetball size but that we'll see how that works and sometimes i get all the way through and have to steal a little from the other one kinda making me even now can they don't have to be perfect fit another thing is and that that the fact that they're in a mass in 10 this is essentially just the meatloaf and the differences most me loves have like a catch it face kind in the weather sketch efforts made a saucer something inside oven i'm with calif that out and just put the eggs in a lot of veggies in there so they're not quite as moist you can if you if you want to you can actually do not call it something push it down in the middle and put like a catch up for a barbecue sauce or something in the you want to they get a little slimy in a little bit messy to take with you so only do that when you play any my at home i think hey we're doing good now looking like an overdoing it yet but and other pdf having them in a muffin tin not only is that it's the right portion but dead the moisture from the veggies stays confined in a little tense so its debt tends to keep the me from getting overly dry cuz you action ground turkey has no fact really so really kenneth just its overcome pretty easily go exciting stuff like to do this which kate looks like i actually maybe have i can make maybe make them a little bit figure self i'm in class 1 at a little bit to hear now if you were to cookies and measure them now and they would usually be about two and a half ounces each so that will come to you you know appid serving size i care and mayo miami heat's i'm maybe three or four the square you know we don't need to you would be her serving and each one in these i depending on how large you make it is gonna be like about seven-year 870 880 calories here you know maybe a little more if you do choose two large ones think these might keep my like easter i make every day i think those packages and check the exact we give them need to know want cell that's good rather have more than less these are really means so good for sale it's pretty good of so i'm 0 can you with an actress i'll about eight carries may be late cute and fat i'm looking at four cards and about i 11 grams protein and that's for all for one mustn't so in get 20 teens approached protein to my fans re: these are ready to go the computer kid stick them in the middle rack and we want cookies for quite a while you never want uncut turkey and so depending on how high revving get i'm and put mine in about 40 that you might have to play with that go over go under just checkin as you go alright so we've got forty minutes to wait so go watch is that congress something and i'll come back and check me think these are about done so sperm out there looking good or not that's no good hell my potholders friend count so they look pretty good okay now we just need to know given time to cool i suggest that you take them out a little bit before they're completely cool and i i'm on a paper towel i just pulled it up on the counter and i them on and let it allowed to use is that accumulate in the bottom to get a little bit dry so that i think for a minute that black bag mini fridge and
