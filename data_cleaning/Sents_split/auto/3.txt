over that medium-low heat now while my milk mixture is coming to a simmer i'm going to just take my egg yolks and sugar with a little pinch assaults am gonna with teeth together until the mixture becomes really nice think and pay all collar actually looks like when he gets there basically essentially what we're making right now is the i am target the %um the unit nothing but was all she became difficult to be is just egg yolks sugar delivered the news in a bit ago but this needs to be with implored really late and pay off and about doubled in volume actually looks like what if they are keeping i out on your milk mixture you do not want to come to a boil because it does a will flake and then you have to start all over and waste all that milk and cream and now i so keep an eye on that in just a couple minutes and then you should be done sleepin egg yolk mixture it well and you're getting of the all work at all while you're at it i'm looking at the right temperature you can feed as little bubbles are starting to form around the edge up the pot which is when i know it and a perfect simmer by and get as you can see i texture this anthony see kinda falls down as on a ribbon now that's perfect let 'em pretty egg yolks by just taking little bit i love my milk mixture just about a half a cup or sell and this is all doing is tempering the egg yolk for that they don't come in you don't get shocked when you pour them into the pan the hot liquid that's all you need to do going to now poor my egg yolk mixture aimed shoot my pant very simple just making it easy easy and very classic ice cream custard pink and now i'm going to look at the color that look at back collar just because they're happy you have no idea okay i switched back to my wooden spoon and let cook this over about a low heat until if they can really nicely and coats the back of my spin and i will show you what it looks like one they are just make sure your you keep this on a low heat and take your time and be gentle because of this comes to a boil or gets too hot it will split it want to split again you will no one is split and there is no going back for just take your time stir it like a figure in figure eight motion i like i'm doing right now and then just be patient and when he gets nice and thick you be able to notice it immediately my custard is ready been cooking for about six minutes and you can see it coming back a spoon if i run my finger down and custer see separated you know if they can a does it again he didn't act with a path mister save can't think anthony eggshells remaining or anything colonel whatever if they've backed it up again to your final mixture as you can see this is smooth sailing all the way that's how i like it i like it ice and snow there's really nothing maybe a little little tiny bit or something remaining but for the most part everything is really nice and okay now you need to wrap this like plastic back and you want to make sure that the catholic it actually typing the surface %uh the custard on what are they just forms are really weird looking skin that you don't want an eighth definitely not gonna be smooth and delightful want to go ahead and freeze there's something a pop this into the fray janiece to be in the fridge for about four to six hours or best overnight death even better cricket but this is the free in the fridge overnight even better some gonna leave this and it's pretty early in the day to day thought get to finish this afternoon and i'll show you what it looks like what's this chill will be going on making our cookie dough and they will put the whole thing off an can't while the custard if telling we're gonna go into making the cookie dough batter now actually making a chocolate chip cookie dough batter here and now if back travel to cookie dough if dat bothers you because nothing net ne this week up to you kinda eating rocky del which i love and i know everybody eat raw cookie dough at some point in their lives now if this bothers you then you might wanna skip this ice cream on in its entirety can make my chocolate ice cream you can make my strawberry mint chocolate chip banana whatever you want i got to recipes on my website but more time cookie dough ice cream have actual cookie dough and that'll make the so delicious i wanna make like we would make chocolate chip cookies but really easy and to do that you'll need some am all-purpose flour i'm going up into thought that and got them instance press a pattern you just a small little pinch found sugar granulated sugar some softened unsalted butter and egg but now axed after what i have here are some chocolate chip type of in my food processor something you can see it got little bubbles at that time there are bigger i found a kind a whole everything i love about cookie dough ice cream is that you actually get bits and pieces of chocolate chips or chocolate throughout the entire ice cream and i think this type of thing in a few times in breaking the peace a bit just give it a little more interest and i think these at pt almost dust like pieces i love the chocolate is what makes this so divine in my opinion so if you wanna skip going up part by all means do that i think crucial have to have a nine by 13 inch baking pan here lancaster a big piece of parchment paper cuz you wanna make sure 18 lifted up that setting aside so that they got i'm going to just came together make butter and both kinds of sugar gonna do this just a smaller balks and feel like a and getting my mixer africa is a small batch just gonna make these two together until combined at the time did not have been added me ank and kenny wanna make sure that whoever you making this for what eat raw cookie dough just wanna make sure that you don't sound have anyone that kenny row and the one not just given a heads up the switch to my with briefly just kill mix everything together a little bit better just mixing together the coffee and sought adding any leavening agents this no baking soda at you need to me you know 8 yet cell them make a difference in the put my egg make sure you normally would put the dry into my wet but i switchboard for some reason and our the flower was inevitable when i just 1/2 to have room to make this together next breath basically on doing i'm just gonna combine this until it performs into a dell making at in can actually and my top it now because it's almost there time as well 101 overworked this anyway had in mind chocolate chip mixture in of add i'm take a bar of chocolate chopped up if you want to that would be lovely adding chocolate chips when you can add me to check but yes see what i mean when i say that i think this is so much better because that way you really getting chocolate iraq every little p m  time bite and the cookie dough i just get to watch it here a talkative their i want to completely abuse throughout the entire cookie dough so that's why i like the part of the nfl her little thing that really make a difference otherwise you know i would get better now okay now i'm gonna put the first me get my cookie dough out of here apps will fix that in a minute do not panic talk to myself by the way now on doing in this is camille little bit tricky i'm trying to get this into pretty thin layer because i'm only free says tonight for the fed a free there we're gonna need to chop it into smoky said but co-lead you can see but i'm not too worried about getting a perfect and i want to be that way about it either and it doesn't have to be all one layer i'm just doing it this way because it easier till cut it when the prison cell just gonna do that and i'm gonna pop this into my finger how it for several hours are a long it takes for the custer to chill caught the more frozen the better e65 to chop it up from the happened fan look i'm now the trust me when i tell you it worked wonders pop in the thin waiting for my culture to can i think all and i will go on and but all in all machine and daggett that much closer to you but i don't think by custard with in the fridge overnight to what's going on in there for a few hours but then we had my aunt over and maybe a cocktail or two and we decided to wait till tomorrow ice cream which is good because it's the weekend perfect time for entertaining and ice cream now i have my ice cream machine here you want to make sure that the insert the ice cream machine which is this guy right here that's going up basically for your ice cream for you is frozen now you wanna check always you manufactures instructions because every ice cream machine is different when other one so my face to put in there overnight to death to do it really nice and solid for a sandwich it's really important so make sure that you read instructions because some i just a couple hours amor most the time will take overnight so now i have my really cold custard which is absolutely fantastic i mean look at that and this would be good on its own as it is i am over top maybe barey these or what not the poor that in the air get it all out up now is how to turn this on now and again check the manufacturer's instructions because it's gone but i'm gonna marry mine takes a good 25 to 30 min you free the ice cream but there are also different some gonna wait for this to be pretty much virtually frozen and then we'll get going on adding our cookie dough ari my it exactly where i wanted about 25 minutes and now gonna take my cookie dough the in the freezer overnight as well which is what we want in this is why did good on parchment because it's so easy and now i just take a shark night ending no particular way i just i'm gonna just wrap this up into bite-size pieces that is it you ken you really can do in this an a couple different ways of doing it the way i'm doing it you can take little teaspoons love the batterer we know months you may get and then put me on a baking sheet lined with parchment and fried it that way and then that you can just clip but the anti ice machine i to do it this way i don't know why i just think it's easier and i'm get the job done a lot faster and you can also leave certain pieces bigger or smaller like that perfect so now i'm just gonna go across and jess broth cha page on everything into that bite size pieces and it and do want to mention that it sounds like this is really hard could it its it's not it just sounds hard because you were rough you know cutting through chocolate i'm i just want to mention that the as i'm done there's something ken you can hear the crunch for the crunch is just because we're chopping up the chocolate tell anyway figured i'd let you guys know that act announced and take the pieces in a you can cut these as big or small as you want and you can add as much or as little as you want to your cookie dough batter it's up to you i'm gonna have no service but most likely not all i think the from my and of for people to served of recalled and this is money yeah buddy now i only added about half a the chocolate in cookie dough mixture in here because i didn't want to add to queue much because then you can also have a hard time with your machine being able to handle all that but look at this i mean and you seeing what i'm seeing and also are you see how those little rubble dove chocolate kinda spread all throughout the batter and that's from when i took the chocolate pieces the child chips and put them through different processor kit that is personally what i like obviously you want big chocolate chips here and there but why have a little bit when you can have chocolates row are look at that i mean just if you get up close you can see that it's really creamy it's got this big chunks have cookie del i'm just to make myself a little ask okay path just just just scoop just scoop on a town i am deserving work 0 go to pieces i'll mmm you love this a promise you will love this it's so easy in taste so much better store-bought i cannot stress enough i can sing the easy to do doesn't take a hard time doesn't take any fancying gradient that's very basic but it done the right where you can seem me it's just it's phenomenal the chocolate pieces in there then on time thing in my head that lauren did not come i have the right to be ready for you let me know what ice cream you wanna teaneck open endorsement mean and i i'm useless my left hip at use what they tell you youth come tony horton's nothing on this for while our custard can be anywhere so our beer cookie dough ice cream how don't
