the that %uh the %uh mom %uh home %uh %uh inde sentence today i'm in the bodybuilding got confidence in him showing you had a mi my chocolate peanut butter protein chris in a previous video i showed you how to make my honey almond protein chris but now we're going to use to my other favorite ingredients chocolate and peanut butter so let's get started the ingredients for chocolate peanut butter protein chris are three cuts ever crispy brown rice we've got one cat a whole it's and sq other than no a protein powder we've got some crushed almonds 7 seen a better rate here some cocoa and some brown sugar and somewhere and you have got mahany thats i can name so let's get started to start i for it three caps at the crispy brown rice and just cc you can't have a reference this is the crispy brown rice a year its and gluten free organic it's got very few ingredients in it does have a little bit a sugar its natural sugar its target lassus and evaporated cane juice but its two grams per serving this before so the company serving so you've got less than five grams if natural sugar in the whole entire espy said not bad and it makes 18 servings so we started with that but that in and i've got my cat the whole its that on top and then i'm gonna add 1/4 cat as crushed almonds so if you don't have pressed are means you can actually just taker an ominous you know about a fourth a couple dozen just beat him with a rolling pin you can ease the back a pot what every whatever you have and then on top of that i'm gonna had once keep vanilla whey protein powder i can i sprinkle out on top 
spread it around a bit now do not mix this up we don't wanna make and all that protein powder settle to the bottom so i just committed to shake anonymous edits aside ok set now miss so it's out to a smaller bowl and in this call now make sure you use an a glass wall that's important because we need to put it in the microwave so and we're gonna start out with our main ingredient which is an all-natural insulted creamy peanut butter you can use twenty if you like but the 20 actually doesn't seem to accept quite as well but have media and an anti-skid really good too so it's just your preference there's a lot a natural oil that comes up from the peanuts so we're gonna for a little bit that of don't pour it all out though because you really have a hard time nixon at so i'm gonna go ahead in makes it see it sorry kinda hard see get the muscle in there mix it up a bit i a and so where you actually take and three forces a cat the creamy on natural peanut butter and add that to the bowl so i like to use my little smaller skip i think it's more manageable but you can use a measuring cup in just measure to three-fourths so i'm going to skip it how up noon this month slightly chunky slightly smears so i think i needed to may be stirred up a little longer sometimes have been known to heat it up a little man in the microwave just to get going but cease we've got r1 force go in smaller and your have to be super super on careful with the measurements in this actual recipe you can add a little take away a little if you want i've actually figured out the ratios just to have just enough so you don't have to you and emailing it to dry wanted to stick together a bit we're trying to make that crispy rice and everything can all come together so that when we freeze a actually makes this crunchy crispy kinda granola honest carolina this is more challenging than then on better now with that said you could use the allman better if you'd like and you can actually add extracts so if you wanted to make say chocolate was like a little bit orange 10+2 orange or something or there's coconut extracts there's been an ass maybe chocolate peanut butter banana might be pretty good you can actually use little he sees a banana if you'd like to you but they will get a little mushy and i don't their make it not stick together as well season sparingly or do the drive finance but again there's added sugar should just be careful about how much do you think is where are you using i did the natural sugar mixing in at its gonna be my honey said we're gonna do half a cup honey so since this is my 1/4 measuring skip 72 eighties sitka one no spatula now honey is really really really good for you i'm often asked about honey verses agave nis agaves better i personally prefer honey i think and there's so many health benefits to it with their anti-oxidants and it's good for your skin and it's getting into bacterial there's just so many great things about it i'd prefer to use it cuz i got the interest it it'll still spike your blood sugar so be careful because a lot of times and some others labels can be misleading you make you think that that's a better choice but and actually still payments to the same thing so alright we've got those two greens in a bowl and now i'm gonna add africa actually as is out all brown sugar blend and allah ta'ala is a sweet it comes from rank raspberries plans it's a natural fit tests sweetener and it's actually sugar alcohol its does not have quite as many calories as regular sugar but it still will have a slight insulin spike it's just a little bit there for you it is organic it is natural and they actually use it in toothpaste it's good for your teeth so read em that in and the brown sugar part adds a little bit have a molasses flavor to it we're making and if you really prefer you can look for something right organic second i which and it has 15 carries for per teaspoon issue adding some calories but it's less sweetness as far as like whiskey and sugar they also tasteless the same i and that having he's more so for me i just like to use this and just kinda it's mainly sav re: into that and when and as you've got the now i am miss you x he stands in our and then i'm going to add my chocolate now the chocolate the preferences that to you can add a couple people sneaking and allotted tablespoons you can use dark chocolate hershey's chocolate whatever kind you'd like to use some people like how you can use anything you'd like so open at st3 in those i prefer for the recipe to use dark chocolate so if you can find the nc in dark chocolate i think thats play your best bet so i minister this set just a little bit just to get the dry stuff incorporated a little and then we want to stick this in the microwave for just about thirty seconds just kinda soften it up so i cant can stir it all together ok that ok me sternest together a bad up unit all unduly dry ingredients incorporated in still help so doing pretty well you might have to stick in there for and maybe another 30 seconds to really get it 5-all and i think im gonna do that with when you add all the cocoa and everything it's it's not quite as and liquefied is when the other espy's at remain like their honey on protein chris so let me stick it back in for 30 more seconds don't do you the minute all at once because you could burn your chocolate and we definitely don't want that sternest together there up yes much easier to stir sound now that i've got it all out i'm gonna go ahead and poor that on top a very dry ingredients here again aspirin smells really good he prolly just eat the chocolate and peanut butter but see its this and i don't share with my dog his ski have chocolate said i'm gonna fall the dry ingredients over the top i like to do the little folding technique is it keeps i spatula from getting too sticky right off the bat very and it does on place might see you have to really work it to start getting all their wedding greens incorporated into the dry i sent might take a little but a little work a little bit a muscle so i think obama's get it all done he can see the protein powder still in there get probably keeps turning cecchin sam keep down a second it might look a bit dry you don't wanna adalat a liquid though because if you do and it'll in that going to use often fall apart so i think it looks pretty good now and we in that thing this in the freezer so it can be hard but do you know that after while if you take out the freezer its gonna get softer and softer and it still tastes awesome she's not quite the same texture because of course the peanut butter and everything softened up a little bit to think we're good all even i'm gonna show the first in four is how i make like when the shapes i brian just a little circle that's pretty easy one demonstrator and if i can you don't need a pep you can't do anything he just use your feel circle and then he's really take a little take a little bit you fingers push it down in new takes little the time it's really pretty pretty simple and then you just wanna firmly pack it in there energy push it all an then just hit me cannons take the little leap of you can see how it turns out turns out that my heart is at it stays that way and it's really nice compact pneumatic its staff come together in mathematics you'd like so need another one of those maybe alternate flavors do one kind is chris and do a different kinda favorite chris me pac spending make it a little bit nearly go so i would fill up the mess in the tray and then stick that in freezer and i'm gonna finish working on these ever i had left him and put in here and a commitment okay the chocolate peanut butter protein chris has been in the freezer for about an hour so we're going to get take that app daily create at to get the ones that we cut into shapes so now they're nice in frozen and solid sarah and if you you are making this and you actually keep
