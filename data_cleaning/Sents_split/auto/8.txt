or fresh coriander a few are British and I don't bother pulling off the stems first launcher I just chop it up really really find is a lot of labor in the stands actually so you can see why don't you can see but I can see with my life by at the cabin has already started to soften up just that little bit and motion in the ocean summers gonna set this aside and work on some other staff and just leave it at room temperature and how she looks like when we're done your BM a test oh my god to be like wow you're a genius okay for the man as fast as I can and day and got Sam man is here I'm going to add some minced chocolate wrappers so to pull a intentarlo they can animal can it's like a dollar and if the ins and overstock that's kinda sweetie and slightly then agree that mostly sweet and hot they're smoked jalapeno peppers in an airport in this do it fast so whenever I get ajar home I like to transfer and milk and how much transfer into a jarring keep in the fridge in are still intact for

about table stand chipotle in adobo plot that innocent man is lick your finger cuz who cares I'm like cooking for myself and this guy doesn't give a shit okay mad them engines so many tables women that synth Sol and a man at a little bit a malt vinegar which is really really good on fried fish an are now klansmen agreements can have ninety in sweet anyway if you can't find this then you can use at smile and use its scalable tartness but also kinda nice cuz the whole fish connection then we're going to mix this up so the sourness and that an internal and you should balance out the heat and it's appalling pretty well but if it's still a little bit too spicy for you know I would recommend that you had a little bit of honey or sugar and to sorta temper that heat a little bit but those tests pretty good to me comes up though on the set aside and start working on the fish so I have changed anything from the original recipe as far as the seasonings and spices and putting on it so the two main things here our son human seeds and sound an ass this is not star anise just aniseed and its kinda liquor she finally flavor if you can't find that you can leave it out but it does get really really nicely with this finance a whole came and seen said those here and Sam chili powder and when I sichuan patter me personally I just mean like ground-up enter chile's ground at New Mexico Chile I don't mean like commercial brand Chile para has garlic salt in our stuff mixed into other that's what you can find and that's what you have in your pantry that AZT holy totally fine please re-up tomato mourner and pesto you can use pre ground spices if you want that you know me Alex me things harmonies of super whole spices and and crushing map can nah my chili powder are any ground thing and salt and pepper cuz to what's life without salt and pepper you wouldn't have that song push it for one thing next I'll okay now for that reading reading heart reading writing weirdo I'm just using some corn you know if you are in another country not the best country in the world America can inked I if you are in another country and you don't have crime you know anything is fine plant basically the same thing that would add this too thats an extra renowned it combined now all we're going to the fish I did the fish last so that I don't have to wash my cutting board between acting like a rock fish jus on things she mmm I'm using them while snapper but you is pretty much any like light ish fishermen you probably could use salmon or something like that here field catfish like and I asked that fishmonger if you would scan it for me so these are skinless and boneless so I'm just gonna cut them into pieces maybe an inch wide by however long it is so that usually ends up being about the race has to go into attack a sheer fish channa you're just gonna toss around and this cornmeal mixture just to cut it we don't really need anything to help here the crime you understand moisture from the fish well keep it on their moist sheesh and you can do this fish coating part had it I'm goin discover I'm leaving the French and after a couple hours and that'll help that coating stick on better to him you can leave them set for a while okay so officials are coded was gonna but it's it here in my little dash for just as long it takes to heat up a skillet with some oil in it and then we'll get to fry and the fish fish wrap I day I C one here can have over comedienne I medium-high heat and then and me 2 tablespoons a canola oil or corn oil peanut oil something kinda neutral the high smoke point so while around like a lava lamp down behind get distracted and then you want to cook your fish in two matches cut the smaller pieces with the smaller pieces in the bigger on Saturday Iran's and
