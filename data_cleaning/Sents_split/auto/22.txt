healthier version from an aggressive and creating banana bread i know it's not very healthy for me i make this instead and it's also a really good meal that you can make on the weekends you can make it in bulk and you can keep it in your fridge during the week we can also freeze that so if you have to get out the door really quickly in the morning this is a great item you can meet for your breakfast now so for today's recipe these are the ingredients are going going to you and we have dry ingredients and wet ingredients organic separately cell for dry ingredients we have 2 cups i'll fashion elf and i prefer the old fashion out so the ins and outs just because they've been a little bit less processed the ins and outs have actually been flattened cooked and dehydrated and so the old fashion it's just been rolled and their little bit better for you and then we have four scoops vanilla whey protein powder you can use any brand you prefer just keep in mind that the different brand will make it a slightly different we have two tablespoons above ground flaxseed and this is actually optional but flack see cuz is forever may get 3 fatty acids and they tell produced the ldl cholesterol the bad cholesterol in a full fiber and antioxidants so to speak for a skillet a healthier and when you find a fax eat it comes in a bad like this the thirty ground in usual confinement in usually in the baking aisle at the grocery store by the other flowers and things like that then we have 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon we have one teaspoon baking powder a fourth of a teaspoon us all and that's just out the baking powder rains and then we have a half cup a stevia in the raw in that's raised for this recipe if your trivia or as i'll tell you can use that as well and then for our wedding gradients i have a half a cup unsweetened applesauce which is also for answers this is the kind i don't got one here applesauce you just wanna make sure that you get one this is no sugar added or natural apple sauce and the most important thing you can do is read the ingredients list so try to find one that all ingredients are apples in water and maybe ascorbic acid and that's just my tendency to help keep the applesauce from turning brown and sometimes i even what all do as i get a little mark containers that are for kids in that way it's like perfect serving size: and i have those me covered for my son anyways and i use a sometimes at the half a cup and then we have 1/2 cups a unsweetened vanilla almond milk inanities almond milk amira fees and settlement because it's low in calories and has less sugar and this is the kind i like iphone for his brand unsweetened vanilla almond milk it only has 40 calories just be careful when you're buying your own not because from the flavors at quite a bit of sugar so again just read the ingredient list and make sure that like this one has 0 grams of sugar in it and then we're going to use a fourth of a cup a love plain greek yogurt in this is the greek yogurt we have today just again make sure that you're getting the non-fat plain greek yogurt make sure you don't get one that's the number flavored or any other flavor because we're gonna have a lot of sugar if you look at the back might have anywhere from five to eight grams sugar and mother over sugars that naturally occur in lactose sound and then we're going to use for egg whites i have my whole x hero crackin weekly recipe and i have two bananas for gonna slice the israeli then and then we have four or five strawberries anyone get big stories that the kinda small anything a fiery and sex and those are all the ingredients were going to use it in a recipe burning so first we're going to do is mix all over dry ingredients together in a bowl so you're going to take a larger mixing all when you want it but the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl because later intimate mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients so just quicker when green for 54 seconds and then we're going to mix to cut serve 0 of for scoops a protein powder our factory one tablespoon have settlement half cup a stevia in there a 1 teaspoon baking powder in 8430 soon as i saw and then think my whiskey and thanks for everything gets mixed together really well sometimes they have gotten lazy and not make that together very well and my baking powder doesn't evenly distributes and then when it could have a bit kenna if flatter than the rest i just wanna make sure the sentiment is gets evenly distributed in the baking powder interest until you can see anymore you know brown spots are white spots isn't it looks nice unmixed out this looks pretty good finance at the set aside and then mexico are wet ingredients and doesn't really matter what order rent-a-car almond milk are greek yogurt in the greek yogurt just add some moisture to the recipe and actually in any recipe you can substitute greek yogurt or applesauce for the better and the oil in a recipe so now we're going to put in our applesauce industries a rubber spatula to get it all out and then we're gonna put interact with now little trick i learned i use it just for my egg whites in the trash can and for some reason i cannot figure out why my house found that out time and then one day i want to go take out the trash and it was rose i could tell a great for egg yolk for seeping through the bottom in the trash bag and my we realize that it was because i was eating so many egg whites reference only and get some trash can and so now i just throw them in the garbage disposal that way it doesn't think upper half i know some people have dogs actually let their dogs ether egg yolks and it's good for their coats but you have any pets %uh to see the garbage disposal house one you also could do the liquid egg whites if you wanna that are come in a carton to sling trees a little bit less than than ratio calls for me think now i'm gonna take my mistake my wes can just makes us all together really well sometimes birth egg white skin kinda stick together a little bit sound slick centel it looks nice and unmixed then we're gonna bring over my nick starring gradients you were just going to combine the and stern altogether have a two-year-old and this is his favorite part i let him usually do you this fine cutting up the bananas or from handle him cut the bananas with me kinda fun to get the kids involved with this recipe it's also a really healthy male you get your your kids to get some whole grains into your diet rights another that's makes women prepare rpn to the side in risk amuse and agent spy p m  you could use a 9-inch pie pan as well if you're happy and you could even just use a a square castro this men just really lightly spray and i don't use a lot of the stuff but i just use the nonstick cooking spray and take a cutting board you were gonna take one for bananas and we're just gonna slice a relief then can if houston pretty thin slices because you want another banana slices that you can wear the entire bottom obtain now finance and turn color after they've been exposed to the air and so know always but sometimes i neighbors does performer and if i let said the fridge for a couple days it kenna turns on with her a purplish color stuff that happens to you don't be alarm that's not there's nothing wrong with its just because the banana once they get exposed to the area they can change color so now what i'm doing is undertaking the banana slices and lining the bottom other p m  and after i'm done whining this then we're gonna pour the batter on top but the main so they say when you bite into it you have banana taste on the bottom and they were gonna put another way opinion is on the top alright so this looks pretty good now what we're gonna do is pour the batter on top of the banana means just evenly distributed there gonna sell the pana all the way to the edge men just screen about the rest honor and then what we're going to do is slice our second banana we're gonna do the same things are going to put a nice where bananas on top and not only does this make it taste good but it also exodus really pretty so the ferry slice rebellion is the more you're gonna be able to put across can in this recipe makes 4 servings so one serving really just has one egg lay a scooper of protein powder and have a couple votes plus a little bit greek yogurt a little bit on the milk it does have half a banana on a little bit %uh spices so this is a really good option for breakfast in if you kinda getting tired of just regular old egg whites and you okay so and distribute the very evenly some military inskeep from these bananas over xp and then wanna do is take my strawberries and again i'm gonna slice pays family then can you don't have to at history's

cared and then i just put the strawberries on top like that yeah i four before serve reserve five star bruce and just too so it's not like that self that say i'm we have other merit preheated the oven to 375 degrees some realistic this and other than and we are going to cook it for about forty to forty-five minutes basically the top is going to be a golden brown and you know it's done once you put a knife in the center and the knife comes out clean of right side effects %uh then we could differ forty-five minutes of and i'm just gonna test it to make sure that the knife comes out clean looks pretty good and as you can see the top %uh this is going to be kind of a golden brown color in what i'm gonna do is let it sit here and rest for between five to 10 minutes just until it cools if i tried to cut into it now it would also give collapse together sir gonna let it cool and set for about five to ten minutes and then after that i will cut it into fourths one serving is one wage say i
