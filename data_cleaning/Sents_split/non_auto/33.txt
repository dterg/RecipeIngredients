<transcript id="33" title="Spicy Potato Salad |  Hilah Cooking " url="Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking" mode="non-automatic">
i've got a new variation on potato salad for you 
it's a spicy potato salad, because i posted it on instagram and a lot of people were like hey, i want to know how to make that 
so, i'm going to show you just in time for the weekend for all of you who are cooking and grilling out some stuff that you're not even inviting me to, you jerks 
okay 
for the potato salad i've got some potatoes 
they're in the pot 
i already boiled them 
i'm pretty sure you can figure out how to do that 
meanwhile, we're going to make this dressing 
i've got some mayonnaise in here 
if you don't want to use mayonnaise you can use sour cream 
i'm going to add some apple cider vinegar 
this is one of my favorite vinegars, and i like to get the one that's unpasteurized because it's got a lot of really good probiotics in it 
that means that it's good for your intestines 
a little bit of olive oil and some mustard 
this is a fun little mustard that suzanne sent me from germany, and it's got pink peppercorns and green peppercorns in it 
if you can't find this, which i've never seen it in the us so i wouldn't be surprised, you can just use some kind of brown deli mustard 
it would be very similar 
about a tablespoon of that 
because this is spicy we're going to add some chili powder 
this is just ground new mexico chili powder without any additional stuff in it 
good, hefty dose of that 
it's not terribly spicy, but it's got a nice earthy flavor 
then, for the spice, a little bit of cayenne, and that's optional 
leave it up to your taste 
that was a few dashes 
some black pepper 
this has got multiple types of peppers in it 
super fun 
some salt 
we'll get this whisked together 
okay 
we can set that aside and cut up our potatoes 
i boiled some red fingerling potatoes 
that's fingerling, gentlemen 
i'm going to leave the skins on 
you could use some red new potatoes or something like that, too, or some white potatoes 
white, or red, or yukon gold, those are all really nice for potato salad 
let's see, maybe cut them lengthwise, just basically bite-size pieces 
it's best to dress the potatoes, mix it up with the dressing while the potatoes are still a little bit warm, because that way they'll absorb more of the flavors from the dressing 
once the potatoes are in there we've got some celery 
you can cut this up any old size you want to 
i like to cut them lengthwise and then in sort of smallish squares 
add that to the bowl, then i'm going to add some red onion that i've diced up 
i tried to kind of keep all the vegetables except the celery red 
get it?
because spicy, red, devils, cupids 
okay 
some fresh red bell pepper 
these are peppadew peppers which look like cherry peppers but they're not really very spicy at all 
they're usually packed in kind of a sweetish brine 
they've got a nice flavor profile 
it's pretty complex 
you can buy them in a jar, or if your grocery store has one of those, like, fancy olive bars they're usually also there 
i've got a couple of those 
you could totally use some cherry peppers instead, although they're going to be hotter than these, so keep that in mind 
or, sometimes you can even find pickled red jalapenos 
perfect, that's all in there 
then, stir it around 
this spoon is ridiculously small for this job 
what am i, an idiot?
don't answer that 
here we go 
to me this kind of potato salad with the spiciness and the extra vinegar goes really, really well with grilled meats and barbecue, heavy meats like beef brisket or lamb 
there we go 
there's our spicy potato salad 
if you like this recipe be sure to check out the greek pasta salad recipe that i just made last week 
also, check out hilahcooking com 
you can get this printable recipe, and also i posted a grilled lamb recipe that would be superb alongside this potato salad 
try that this weekend, send me a picture of what you made, and i will love you forever, with my clothes on 
did i go out of frame?
sorry 
that's delicious 
it's tangy and refreshing and spicy, and i love it, and i hope you try it
