hi, this is stephanie manley with copykat com 
don't you just love cracker barrel's fried apples?
well, guess what?
i'm going to show you how to make cracker barrel's famous fried apples, at home and in your own kitchen 
all right, so i'm just finishing chopping up my apples 
you can make this recipe with about five or six apples 
my recipe calls for either butter or bacon drippings 
now the cracker barrel doesn't use bacon drippings in theirs, but you know what?
this tastes really good with bacon drippings, and that's how my grandma used to do it, so i can testify that that makes them very, very tasty 
this recipe just has a few ingredients in it 
that's about five or six tart apples, some brown sugar, a little bit of nutmeg, some cinnamon and lemon juice 
so after you finish slicing up all of your apples, you want to keep them a nice pretty color, so we are going to add just a little bit of lemon juice to this, and give it a stir before we take this over to the stove and start cooking our fried apples 
okay, so we're going to get started on our apples 
we're going to take our butter and melt that in the bottom of our skillet 
again, you can go ahead and use bacon drippings if you happen to have bacon drippings 
it'll taste just as good 
i'm going to let that butter get nice and melted, and next i'm going to add my apples 
i'm just going to pour them evenly on the bottom of my skillet 
i'm cooking these on a medium heat, not too high, and not too low 
i am using an all-clad skillet here, but you know what?
i've seen many chefs use far less expensive skillets, so i think any skillet will really do 
in fact, an iron skillet will be great for this as well 
all right, so my butter is all nice and melted right now, and the apples are just beginning to release some of their juices 
so now we are going to sprinkle in our brown sugar, so we've added in our brown sugar, it's just beginning to melt 
i am going to add in my cinnamon, and i am going to add in a little bit of nutmeg, and i'm just going to stir to incorporate 
these smell just incredible 
now this butter and brown sugar is going to make a really, nice, thick syrup, so these apples will fry in syrup, and the butter 
it's going to take about 15-20 minutes for these to finish up 
then we'll come back, when they're all nice and done 
all right, so we're about halfway cooking these apples, and you can see we have this wonderful thick syrup right here 
so while these are cooking, just be sure to stir them every couple minutes 
you're going to have some fabulous fried apples, so now you know how to make cracker barrel fried apples, but you know what?
