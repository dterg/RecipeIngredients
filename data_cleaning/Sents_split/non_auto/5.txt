thank you for joining me here on copycat recipes 
today i'm going to show you how to make cracker barrel chicken tenders 
they are really easy to make and they're going to taste just like they do in the restaurant, and they have just four simple ingredients in them 
let me tell you what's in them 
we're going to have chicken tenders in here 
now if you don't have chicken tenders, you can use a boneless skinless breast 
just cut it up into strips that are about one-inch wide and those will be perfect 
we're going to use italian dressing, any brand will do 
honestly, don't spend a lot on this 
just buy what's ever on sale 
it's going to be great 
we're also going to use a little bit of honey and a couple of limes for a little bit of citrus zest 
we're going to mix up the marinade 
we're going to marinade these chicken tenders for about an hour 
then we're going to cook them and they'll be perfect and they'll taste just like they do in the restaurant 
so we're going to begin by making the marinade and this is really, really easy to do 
you are going to take one lime and slice it, and we're just going to go ahead and squeeze the lime into our container 
now, i am mixing my marinade in the same container that i'm going to marinade the chicken in 
that way i can save a dish 
be on the lookout for any seeds, just in case that they come in 
you're going to need about a tablespoon of honey 
then you're going to need about half a bottle of the italian dressing 
this is a 16 ounce bottle 
so we're going to use about half of this for the marinade 
italian dressing, you can marinade anything in it 
vegetables, steaks, all kinds of stuff 
all right 
so i'm going to give this a quick little stir 
then i'm going to simply put my chicken in here 
now i have about a pound of chicken in here 
if you have a little bit more, that'll be fine 
we're going to marinade the chicken now 
now marinade only works for the first time 
so after we finish cooking the chicken you need to discard the marinade and don't use it again 
so we're going to give this a quick little shake 
put this in the fridge and we're going to come back in an hour and we're going to show you how to cook these up 
all right 
so our chicken has been marinating for just about an hour and it's time to go ahead and cook it 
now, i'm just using a regular skillet, just a nice large flat bottom skillet 
i'm going to stick a little bit of oil in the bottom of the pan 
you can use olive oil, vegetable oil, it really doesn't matter 
you want to let this get a little bit warm 
and remember for when it comes to this chicken marinade, don't use it again 
it's for one time only 
you can see it smells really good right now 
and we will begin cooking it in just  a second 
okay, so we're going to begin cooking the chicken 
our pan is hot now 
so you're just going to shake off the marinade here and just drop it in the pan 
you're going to need to cook these on a medium, medium high heat for a couple of minutes on each side 
it's not going to take any time at all 
all right, now that i've put all the chicken in the pan, you don't want to crowd it, you want to give it a little bit of space so it cooks nice and evenly 
be sure to discard the fork that you use for the marinade and get another one 
we don't want raw chicken to contaminate anything else, so it's a clean fork right here 
these are again, going to take about two to three minutes on each side and we're going to have perfectly cooked cracker barrel chicken tenders 
so you're going to know the chicken is starting to cook, if you look on the side of the chicken you'll see that it's starting to turn white 
this will help you know that the chicken is actually cooking 
no one likes raw chicken 
so go ahead and make sure your chicken is cooked thoroughly 
so my chickens not yet ready to turn over just yet 
so i'm going to put it back down and wait another minute or so and it should be nice and brown 
you can see this chicken is just starting to brown nicely, so i'm going to go ahead and flip it 
okay, you can see this chicken is wonderfully browned now 
we're going to go ahead and take it out of the pan here 
this stuff is great on salads 
you might just want to make some up 
serve it on a plate with a couple of vegetables and you have dinner that didn't take too long at all 
you could marinade this before you leave for work or even the night before for a little extra flavor 
and here you go 
there are some wonderful cracker barrel chicken tenders 
so we've just made the cracker barrel grilled chicken tenders 
that was really easy 
it just took four ingredients
