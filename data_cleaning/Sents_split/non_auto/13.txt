[music] hi, i'm jamie eason and today i'm in the bodybuilding com kitchen, excited to show you how i make my cinnamon swirl protein bread 
it's one of my favorite things to eat 
i can eat it at as a snack or even as a meal, because it's got your healthy carb, and your healthy protein 
so, let's get started 
first thing you're gonna want to do is preheat your oven to 350 degrees 
the next thing i did was i got my pan ready 
this is an 8-by-8 inch pyrex dish 
i just did a light little nonstick spray and you can set that aside 
and then i get all my ingredients together 
and for this i want a large bowl for my dry ingredients and a smaller bowl for my wet ingredients 
so, the first ingredient i'm using is oat flour 
in the supermarket this is what oat flour looks like 
now, i'm often asked if this is gluten-free 
and oats typically are gluten-free, but one thing to note is that unless it doesn't indicate it on the bag, you're never really sure if maybe it was cross contaminated in processing 
so, for this one it doesn't indicate gluten-free, but for the most part oats are, but if you're concerned, be sure to look for that indication on the label 
if you can't find the oats in the supermarket, you can actually make your own 
you can use a coffee grinder and just grind a little bit at a time or you could use a blender 
just make sure to know that sometimes you can't get it as finely ground as what's in the package 
so, you might have to increase the amount that you're using for the recipe 
in this large bowl i've added a 1 1/2 cup of the oat flour 
and to that i'm gonna add a vanilla whey protein 
now, you can use whichever one you'd like 
there's two scoops in here 
make sure to know, though, that the different flavors from the different manufacturers will make them taste differently 
so, i like to use one that has as few ingredients in it as possible; the cleaner, the better 
so, i'm gonna dump that into my oat flour 
and then to that i'm gonna add my salt 
now, if you use a leavening agent like baking soda or baking powder, you usually need salt, because that makes it react 
add those in 
and then to this dry ingredient batter i'm gonna actually add 1/4 cup of stevia 
this is what stevia looks like at the supermarket 
stevia is a great natural sweetener because it's no calorie and it has no carb 
but i don't typically use just stevia alone to sweeten my recipes, because it can be kind of bitter 
there's different brands of stevia 
there's stevia and there's another brand called truvia 
truvia's a great option too, but it's typically more expensive 
there's two sides to the stevia plant 
this one tends to be slightly more bitter 
it is cheaper 
and then the truvia you usually see it in packets or in a little tiny tub for baking 
we're going the cheap route today 
so, that's it for our dry ingredients 
we do have these two other ingredients 
these are the extra special ones that just make it extra yummy 
but we're gonna use those later, so i'm gonna keep those to the side 
i'm gonna get my whisk and just mix this up really well 
make sure i get that baking powder all incorporated, because sometimes if you don't it won't bake evenly 
so, i think that looks good 
so, i'm gonna set that to the side and get the smaller bowl ready for my wet ingredients 
for the wet ingredients we're gonna need two egg whites 
you can actually use a whole egg if you want to use a whole egg 
but i prefer to minimize the fat in pretty much any recipe if i can do that and my second egg 
and if you ever drop the yolk in there, you can just use the same shell to fish it out 
it comes right out, so 
i've dropped plenty 
and then to the eggs i'm gonna add one jar of baby food applesauce 
now, you can use regular applesauce, but one of the reasons i like the baby food brand is there's typically no additives, as long as you read the label 
there's no additives and it's nice and portion controlled 
so, i'll open that, get all the good stuff off the top, and then scoop this out 
but again, just unsweetened applesauce from the jar that works just as well 
that's my additional sweetener--one of them to the stevia, which actually will cut some of that bitterness 
next thing i'm gonna add is gonna be my yogurt 
and i choose greek yogurt, because greek yogurt actually has less sugar and it has added protein 
so, i only need a half a container of this 
so, i'm gonna scoop that out 
that's gonna add some moisture to this bread 
the baby food applesauce and the yogurt actually replace the butter and oil in a traditional recipe 
so, i'll add that 
and then for a substitute for milk i'm using my unsweetened almond breeze 
now, almond breeze, again, i like this better than say soy or rice milk, because it has, again, added protein 
so, it's just more nutritious and it's healthy fat 
so, i'll add that 
i'm gonna do about a cup 
and that's about it for my wet ingredients 
make sure i combine that really well 
this is really a pretty simple recipe 
and it tastes really, really good 
it's, again, one of my favorites 
you can actually make this in either the 8-by-8 like we're gonna do or you can do it in a traditional loaf pan 
now that i've mixed all the wet ingredients, i'm gonna add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients 
so, i'll get my large bowl back 
and i'm gonna get my little rubber spatula, so i can get all of the wet ingredients out of there 
just really scrap the bowl 
the more moisture, the better, 'cause then they'll be nice and moist and stay that way 
not get dried out 
so, i've added the wet to the dry and i'm gonna mix that 
and let's see 
and you want it to be slightly runny, because it needs to pour really easily 
so, if it's too thick, you can always add a little bit more of the almond breeze or almond milk, whichever brand you want to choose 
alright, that looks pretty good 
i'm always tempted to lick it, but i won't 'cause there's raw eggs in there 
so, i'm now gonna set this to the side again because now i'm gonna start using my special dry ingredients 
here i've got my cinnamon and i've got xylitol 
now, xylitol is the other brand of sweetener that i like to use or the other type of sweetener, because this one, even though it's no calorie, it actually has carbs, but it is far less bitter than something like stevia 
so, i find whenever i use both it kind of balances out that bitterness 
so, i'm gonna add my cinnamon to my xylitol 
this is a 1/3 of a cup 
you can use more or less 
i just like my cinnamon swirl protein bread pretty sweet 
and i'm gonna add 2 or 3 teaspoons of cinnamon 
again, however much you like 
i added 3 
i really, really like cinnamon 
so, i'll pour that in 
you mix that up really well 
now, xylitol does tend to be a little more granular than traditional sugar and more granular than the stevia, but i think that's good, because it actually helps sort of maintain that layer that we're trying to create in our protein bread 
and also, i don't know if you know, but xylitol is actually the same thing that's used in fluoride toothpaste and it's actually good for your teeth 
so, imagine that; a sugar that's good for your teeth 
so, i think that's nice and mixed 
looks pretty good 
so, now i'm gonna set these things aside 
grab my pan 
now, we'll start putting together our dessert 
i'm gonna pour a really shallow layer on the bottom of the pan, kind of spread that out 
the thinner, the better, because if you pour half the batter, which seems like that should be fine, typically you're gonna kind of miss that little cinnamon layer that's in between 
so, i'll spread that out really well 
that looks pretty good 
and again, depending on your protein, the consistency of your batter might vary a little bit 
so, now i'm gonna add my cinnamon xylitol mixture--cinnamon sugar, we'll just call it that 
sounds better 
and it's pretty heavy 
i like to actually add more than half 
so, that's covered pretty well 
got about that much left, i guess, for the top 
and that's what my middle looks like 
so, then i'm gonna pour the rest of the batter on top 
and you just kind of want to do it where it's, you know, even 
make sure you get it all covered and    alright, that looks pretty good 
so, i'm gonna spread that out 
and then i'm just gonna add the rest of the cinnamon sugar on top 
the nice thing about this too is that it looks really pretty 
and if you make it actually in the loaf pan, you can cut slices and actually use it to make french toast, which is pretty good as well 
so, i'm gonna take my knife now and to make a swirl i'm gonna draw my knife through the batter 
can do it however you want just kind of make sure it's incorporated 
i just kind of go back and forth a little bit 
now i'm gonna put it in the oven that remember i preheated before at 350 degrees 
okay 
it's been 24 minutes 
let's check our cinnamon protein bread 
your oven, depending on the temperature, they kind of vary sometimes it's 24 minutes, sometimes it might be more like 30 minutes 
so, let's check and see how ours looks 
okay 
it looks pretty good 
i think now we've got to let it cool down for about 5-10 minutes before we can actually cut it into serving sizes 
okay, now i'm gonna cut this into serving sizes 
let's see 
i do about three cuts this way and then three in the opposite direction 
and that should make 16 for your 8-by-8 inch pan 
and about two squares really would be a serving size 
for a guy you could get away with maybe three or even four if you really, really want to indulge, i guess 
but two squares is gonna have, you know, just around only 100 calories and it's about 8 or so grams of protein, about 8 carbs 
it just depends on the type of protein that you decide to use 
so, looks pretty good 
you can see the little, hopefully you can kind of see the little layer of cinnamon in there 
it's a little harder to see here, 'cause my cutting skills are poor 
but, let's see what it tastes like 
tastes pretty good 
[giggling] you're gonna want to make sure you store these in the frigerator 
there's no artificial flavors or preservatives 
and also, if you want to see how i pack these to take them with me when i travel, check out the pumpkin protein bar video and for this recipe check the bottom of the page
