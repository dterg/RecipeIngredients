hi guys, jillian beck back with another healthy recipe with bodybuilding com 
today i'm gonna be showing you my lettuce-wrapped turkey muffins 
i know there are a lot of turkey muffin recipes out there 
this is just my version 
it's pretty simple 
it's very versatile so i'm just gonna show you how to put it together, give you some different options, but you can play around with it and we'll get started 
it should take about 25 minutes to make altogether with the baking 
it's gonna be in the oven for 20 minutes at 375 and then it takes about 5 minutes just to throw everything together 
so what you're gonna need is our ground turkey 
i usually go 96% and above 
right now i think this is 96% lean 
if i'm closer to like a show or a photo shoot, i definitely go leaner, 99% is what i usually go with 
so i got this 
i basically just went through my fridge since we're doing kind of mid-week meal prepping at our house and kind of just grabbed whatever veggies i had in stock 
and so we have some spinach, some bell pepper and some onions and then i usually like to throw in like a fresh herb 
i've done fresh basil, i think that was last week and this week i'm gonna do some fresh cilantro 
so those are the veggies we're gonna use to throw in with the ground turkey 
you'll also need one egg white and then our seasonings 
and i like to use bragg's liquid aminos 
it's a natural soy sauce alternative 
i go with my staples of seasonings which is garlic, ginger and then a little bit of sea salt and cracked pepper 
and then you'll need some cooking spray for our muffin tin and then some romaine lettuce leaves like for the hearts to wrap the turkey burger or turkey muffins in 
so it's really simple, really easy 
i've got the turkey already in here 
i've chopped our veggies up so i'm just gonna go ahead and add those 
and so you don't have to like stick with the exact veggies that i do 
definitely play around with what you like and what you have in your fridge at the time 
we're gonna throw that in there 
there's kind of the staples we have around 
if we have some green onion, i like to throw that in there as well 
if i want them spicy, i put in some chili flakes 
these are just gonna be pretty standard and they're just great to have on hand during the week 
you know, for quick lunches, you can break them up and put it over brown rice if you want some carbs 
if we have them for dinner, i usually just wrap them in the romaine lettuce leaves and so they're really good that way 
and then i put some mustard or walden farms like barbecue sauce is amazing so i like that as well 
i'm gonna add my one egg white here 
and some turkey muffins call for like quinoa flour or out flour to help bind everything but like i said, mine's pretty simple, basic 
i don't have a ton of ingredients and so it's just egg white, turkey and veggies and i like to keep it simple that way 
so i'm adding these spices and i don't really measure them, but i would say maybe it's like 1 teaspoon, but i just kind of go with eyeballing it since i do this all the time so 
and then for the liquid aminos, i would say 1--let's see here, 1 teaspoon about so 
we'll mix all these ingredients together 
you can get in there with your hands too and really make sure everything is combined well 
i'm just using this wooden spoon here 
it's almost ready 
it's kind of just a different version of the turkey burgers that i make 
so when i want to do turkey burgers like if we're having a barbecue or, you know, and i want to make my own burgers, i'll do turkey burgers with a recipe very similar to this but i'll make patties and i'll grill them up and then wrap them in butter leaf lettuce 
but these muffins are just super easy, especially when you're, you know, in the kitchen so much and doing a lot of meal prep 
so, i just wanted to keep it simple and healthy for you guys 
so that's all mixed 
i'm gonna ahead and spray the muffin tin with this pam 
good to go 
i'm gonna use a spoon here too 
i'd say it's like a baseball size for each muffin and we'll just pop that in there 
and so if you want to find out kind of like what your macros for this meal are, definitely what i do is take like two muffins and put it on the scale and kind of measure it out and see what i'm at 
i usually try to go for 3 to 4 ounces of protein and that's usually about 200 calories or less 
i mean it's all just veggies in here so it's not a whole lot of anything else 
so depending on what your macronutrient needs are, you can have two or three, you know, turkey muffins or more than that if you're trying to put on some more size or muscle and you need a higher dose of protein so 
almost ready here 
and that made perfect 12 muffins 
put that back on here 
sit that aside 
my hands are really gross right now so i'm gonna go rinse them real quick 
okay, so here are our turkey muffins before they go in the oven 
so i'm gonna go ahead and put them in there at 375 for 20 minutes and i will be right back 
all right, guys, so the turkey muffins are done 
they've baked for about 20 minutes at 375 and i went ahead and let them cool off for about 2 minutes or so 
and i've taken out the romaine lettuce hearts and i placed two muffins on there, if you can see them 
and--i guess you can't but they're there 
and i'll go ahead and probably put some spicy mustard on there 
if i'm getting a little crazy with it, i might add some avocado, which will be a really excellent choice, especially for dinner time if you're, you know, omitting like any other carbs and you want to add some extra fats, sliced avocado on these would be excellent 
so yeah, i might do some spicy mustard and avocado, but again it's your choice 
you can add walden's barbecue sauce 
some low-sugar ketchup would be good 
so feel free to make it your own 
it's really simple, really quick and delicious
