i'm natalie hodson, here today in the bodybuilding com kitchen showing you how to make a recipe that i make a lot of mornings, and it's my blueberry protein pancake 
this is a really good recipe 
if you're getting tired of the same old egg whites and oats 
this uses the exact same ingredients 
it just mixes them into a different way 
i know there's a lot of protein pancake recipes out there, but i like this one because it uses all whole foods and it tastes really good 
these are all the ingredients that we're gonna use for today's recipe 
we're gonna use 6 egg whites, and 1/2 cup of old fashion oats 
i like the old fashion oats better than the instant oats just because they're a little bit less processed 
the instant oats have actually been cooked and dehydrated to make them cook faster, and these haven't 
they've just been rolled 
we have 1/4 cup of blueberries 
you can use fresh or frozen or you can substitute it for raspberries or strawberries 
we have 1/2 cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk 
and just make sure that when you get the almond milk, you're getting the unsweetened vanilla kind 
i like the almond breeze brand 
it's 40 calories, has no sugar in it 
also, if you wanted, you could substitute milk, but i prefer the almond milk 
and then we have 1 teaspoon of baking powder 
this is just to help the pancakes rise a little bit 
two packets of truvia 
this is to make them a little bit sweeter 
i have 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce and just a dash of cinnamon 
and those two items we're gonna save 'til the end and use it as a topping on top of the pancakes 
so for today's recipe, i'm actually gonna use a blender to mix everything together 
and i'm gonna start with my liquid ingredients 
gonna pour in my almond milk, and then i'm going to do my egg whites 
and i'm just gonna crack these right into the blender 
now some people just throw their yolks away into the trash can 
i actually like to put mine in the garbage disposal, and i found that out the hard way 
i used to just throw my yolks into the trash can, and one day i came home and my house smelled really bad and i couldn't figure out why 
and it's because i left the yolks in the trash can for too long, and so now what i do is i'll just put them right into the garbage disposal 
some people like to feed the egg yolks to their dog, and i guess that helps with their coat and makes it a little bit shinier 
and this is a really good breakfast recipe if you have kids 
i have a 2 year-old and he loves this recipe 
we eat it a couple times a week 
and it's a really good way to incorporate some whole grains into their diet, and the blueberries has some really good antioxidants 
another thing you can do is you can make these in bulk on the weekend, and then freeze them 
i think they taste a little bit better fresh but you definitely can freeze them 
and when i do that i just put them in a ziploc bag and then when i wanna eat them, i stick them in the microwave for about a minute 
alright 
so we have 6 egg whites 
then i'm just gonna add my oats 
and i'm gonna save the blueberries until we're actually in the griddle 
i'm gonna add my baking powder 
i'm just gonna do a dash of salt 
it's probably about 1/8 of a teaspoon if you were to measure it 
and then two packets of truvia 
if you want to eat the pancakes without any applesauce on top, you could add a third pack of truvia 
it would make your pancakes sweet so you wouldn't need to add the applesauce on top 
and then i'm just gonna blend this really fast 
alright 
i'm quickly gonna turn my skillet on to about medium-high heat 
then i'm just gonna spray it with a little bit of non-stick cooking spray 
and then i'm just gonna take my batter and--this recipe makes two pancakes 
two pancakes is one serving so usually just kinda eyeball it 
and put about half of the batter in the skillet, and then i'm gonna take half of my blueberries and just drop them in the top 
you can blend these, the blueberries, in too if you want 
i've done that before, but i think it tastes a little better this way 
makes them a little bit juicier 
so we're just gonna let this cook 
usually you can tell they're ready to flip when there's bubbles in the center of the pancake 
so i went ahead and flipped the pancake 
we've been cooking it about 1 to 2 minutes on each side 
and sometimes the first pancake doesn't flip quite as well as the second pancake, and it's because sometimes in the blender the egg whites tend to kinda stay at the top and the oats fall to the bottom, but this one turned out pretty good 
so i'm just gonna take the pancake and put it on my plate 
i'll flip it i guess 
that side's not quite as pretty 
and then i'm gonna go ahead and put my second pancake in 
i'm just gonna blend it for just a second to get everything shaken up 
gonna spray my pan with the spray 
then i'm just gonna pour the rest of my batter in 
make sure to get all those oats out 
and i'm gonna add the rest of my blueberries 
and we're just gonna let it cook about 1 to 2 minutes per side 
you know it's ready to flip once the edges look like they're cooked all the way through and there's bubbles starting to form in the center of the pancake 
alright 
so we are done cooking our second pancake 
i'm gonna go ahead and put it on the plate 
oops 
as you can see, this is a lot of food 
this is another reason i like this recipe is 'cause it's really great way to start the day with a nice hearty meal 
and then--the pancakes are really sweet on their own i think, and so a lot of times i'll actually eat these even without any applesauce on top 
you can use sugar free syrup if you want, but i prefer to stay away from that just because it has a lot of preservatives in it 
so sometimes if i want a little extra something on top, i'll use some unsweetened applesauce 
just make sure you get the applesauce that says no sugar added or unsweetened or if you read the ingredient list, the only ingredients are apples, water, and maybe ascorbic acid which helps keep the coloring 
so i'm just gonna go with this half of a cup of applesauce 
i'm just gonna pour it on top 
sometimes i like to put a little bit underneath 
and then i like cinnamon so i'm gonna put a dash of cinnamon on top 
you don't have to do that if you don't like cinnamon 
sprinkle a little cinnamon on top and there you go 
you have a really good breakfast 
one serving is 2 pancakes, and each serving has 6 egg whites, and 1/2 a cup of oats, some blueberries, and some almond milk
