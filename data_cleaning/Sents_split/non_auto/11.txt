okay, so today i'm here with maureen and bria--my client maureen and her daughter, she's 10 years old 
maureen is 38 
and so we're gonna be doing kale chips, cacao kale chips 
this was my little phenomenal recipe that i developed 
they're just grabbing two bunches of kale chips--raw, organic kale 
and taking off the leafs, putting it in here 
so i'm gonna let them work away at that 
so kale is a super food 
you know, people always ask, "what's a super food?
" there isn't one super food, but this is definitely a very nutritious food, and it's got a lot of phytonutrients, disease-fighting properties, which is what we want 
so cacao kale chips, again, two bunches of kale, you've got coconut oil 
and again, another oil of your choice 
you can do, even, an almond oil if you want 
i have almond meal, as well 
then i have some stevia and organic cacao powder that we're gonna be mixing in 
so with kale chips, a lot of times i see people on social media posting, you know, that they put them in their oven, put them at 350 
that is a choice for you, you can do that for about 10 or 15 minutes 
however, i'm gonna tell you the importance of why getting a dehydrator is actually gonna help with getting those nutrients in 
so i have my excalibur with me, which santa brought to me 2 years ago 
and thankful for that 
the importance of a dehydrator is it doesn't kill the enzymes 
and the enzymes are so important because it keeps the nutrients alive 
the whole reason we're eating vegetables is because of the powerhouse foods that they are 
so when you're cooking them above a certain level, you're actually killing all the nutrients 
so again, i'm 40 years old, i didn't have all these tools when i was in my 20s or 30s, so it's, you know, over time i've made an investment in certain pieces of equipment that have actually helped my kitchen and the foods i eat work better for me 
so, maureen, how do you incorporate kale for your family?
well, for bria i put it on her sandwich for school for her lunch 
and at home, just for dinner instead of lettuce, or i even mix it with other types of lettuce, spinach or mustard greens 
and we can have it in a salad, we can have it with turkey burger, chicken 
that sounds good 
i'm gonna have to get some recipes from you 
okay, so bria, do you like kale 
yeah 
you don't, like, throw it in the garbage 'cause you're at school and mom can't see that you're not eating it?
no, i eat it in my sandwich 
very good, very good 
so there you have it, a great way to get kale in for your kids to enjoy it 
so let's go ahead, if you wanna go ahead and grab the other ingredients here 
let's get the almond meal in here 
i'm gonna help these guys while they're going ahead and getting off all the leafs 
so again, i'm putting in a couple tablespoons here 
so, like i said, measuring great, but overtime, you know, an extra tablespoon or 2, it's not gonna hurt you 
you wanna put some stevia?
go ahead and sprinkle that in 
so again, some stevia to taste 
and then i've got the cacao powder 
so again, if you love chocolate, it's great 
and then i'm gonna go ahead and pour the oil in 
again, you can measure and do a couple tablespoons, but again i want all that powder to stick 
three people making kale chips 
this is a good workout for the arms 
okay 
we good?
awesome 
so here, i love these mixing bowls, they're my favorite 
okay, who wants to shake it up?
you're the dancing queen, let's go 
shake it up 
there we go!
fun in the kitchen with bria and maureen 
so, when they're done, you're gonna see, like i said, you can put 'em in the oven 
and i'm gonna have you scoot forward here 
so why don't you go ahead, open that up, let them see 
so this is how they look 
and you can kind of mix it up a little bit more 
but when they're done, they're nice and crispy 
and a crunch--they're so good 
so good 
go ahead, grab one 
delicious 
so thanks for joining us on "nicole's healthy minutes
