<transcript id="1" title="Breakfast Enchiladas! |  Hilah Cooking " url="Hey, dudes. I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah" mode="non-automatic">
cooking, we're making breakfast enchiladas filled with potatoes and chorizo, topped with fried eggs with a homemade chili sauce 
these are going to go great with all of your breakfast margaritas 
alright 
numero uno 
that means number one in spanish 
we're going to make our chili sauce 
so, i've got here a couple of dried pasilla chilies 
they're pretty sweet and tasty and delicious 
i'm just going to break the stems off 
i've already given them a little rinse, just to get any dust or pesticide residue or anything like that off of them, since they're not organic 
sorry, jesus 
i'm going to add about a cup of water or maybe a little more 
all we're going to do is bring this to a boil 
when it boils, i'm going to turn the heat off and just let it sit for about ten minutes to get reconstituted 
so, i'm actually going to move this to this back burner while that happens 
do a little magic switcharoo here and work on numero two 
this totally looks like a number two here 
alright 
what this is is not a turd 
it's some chorizo sausage, some fresh mexican chorizo sausage 
i'm just going to cook this over sort of a medium-high heat, until it's cooked through and in really fine crumbles 
you could totally leave this out 
i've made these vegetarian before, and they're just delicious 
but i had some chorizo, so i'm going to add it 
[music] 
once most of the fat has released, you can be pretty sure that it's almost cooked 
so, i'm going to add some diced onion 
we just want to soften this a little bit 
i still want to keep some of the crunch integrity of the onion, but maybe not like fully raw onions 
although, you totally could 
it's also fine that way 
this is a very flexible recipe, as long as you have the chili sauce and the potatoes, and even, you could totally just buy a can of enchilada sauce and make enchiladas and serve them for breakfast with an egg on top 
i don't give two shits 
okay 
so, our water on the chilies is boiling 
that's great 
i'm going to drop in a couple cloves of raw garlic, just like that 
bloop 
put the lid back on it 
turn it off and just let it sit there for ten minutes to get softened up 
okay 
onions are getting just barely translucent 
go ahead and turn the heat off 
i've got two red potatoes here that i boiled a couple days ago, and then peeled and just cut into pretty big cubes 
and then, i'm also going to add some baby spinach 
tear it up a little bit 
ew 
gross 
i want my money back 
but like i said, yeah, this is totally still a hearty meal if you leave the chorizo out 
the meat is not integral 
i don't know 
take it out 
it's not necessary for the recipe to work 
just a little extra bonus, because chorizo is the new bacon, y'all 
i just declared that for 2014 
pass it on 
just going to mash up those potato chunks a little bit to help this filling stick together 
that's just going to make it easier to roll up 
okay 
them the last thing i'm going to add to the filling is some crumbled up cotija cheese 
this is a mexican cheese 
it's very firm and salty, kind of reminds me of a merman's dick because it's firm and salty 
okay 
anyway, i'm just imagining that merman have perpetual boners 
but anyway, just a little bit of this, maybe an ounce or so 
just add a nice saltiness 
so, we're not adding any other salt to this because between the chorizo and the cotija, we've got it made 
but if you were leaving either one of those out, you probably want to add a little bit of salt 
mix that around 
and this is not a melting cheese 
it stays in chunks, and they just kind of get soft 
so, it adds a nice little textural bite in there, a little chewy cheese curd kind of feel 
you could use other types of cheese too 
just going to pull them out by the tips 
pull it out by the tip and let all the seeds drop out 
you could leave them in if you wanted a really spicy sauce, but i don't know 
to me, this doesn't really need to be like super hot 
these peppers have a really nice fruity flavor 
and the little garlic cloves that i dropped in 
so, they'll still have a little bit of a rawness to them, but they're not going to be so sharp and spicy 
so, i'm going to add, to start with, about a half cup of this soaking liquid 
that's why i rinsed these peppers off first, because you want to be able to use this liquid, but not if it's full of weird gross shit, just jizz it around 
important safety note 
when you're blending hot things in a blender, pressure builds up, and the lid can blow off 
so, make sure that you allow it to like vent, just by sort of leaving a little thing like that 
or if you don't have like a little cap, you can just cover the blender with like a towel or something, doubled up, so you don't splatter your hand with hot liquid 
okay 
safety lesson over 
whoa, guys 
that was loud 
okay 
i'm going to check the consistency 
alright, that looks pretty good 
smells delicioso 
i'm going to add a little bit of salt, maybe a quarter teaspoon or so 
that's it 
our sauce is done 
so, we can get rid of this 
magically, it goes over there 
and then, for the enchilada part, i've got some corn tortillas 
typically, or traditionally, they're sort of like warmed up and softened in some warm oil before you roll the enchiladas 
i have a cheer white girl method, and i'm just going to actually spray them with a little bit of spray oil 
boop 
boop 
boop 
boop 
boop 
boop 
then, stick them in the microwave for about 30 seconds, and you will see how beautifully pliable they become 
okay 
see?
these are nice and hot and soft 
your mileage may vary 
you might need to put them in for a little bit longer, 60 seconds or so 
but, looks good to me 
so, we're going to put a little bit of our sauce down here 
and then, you just want to dredge each tortilla in a little bit of this sauce 
it's going to be a little bit messy 
don't wear your best shirt 
couple tablespoons of your filling 
and then, shove it on back 
a lot of times when i'm just making these for chris and i, i'll just do like a half batch, and i won't even bother heating up in the oven 
i'll just do it on a plate and like, microwave them or something 
so, this last one, you've got to do a little maneuvering, a little houdini-ing to get it covered, but you can do it 
i promise you'll manage 
alright 
muy bien 
now, i'm just going to pour the rest of the sauce over the top 
well, maybe save a little bit back because it looks really pretty when you top it with egg 
you can add a little bit more sauce on top of the egg too 
okay 
gorgeous 
alright 
i'm going to put this in the oven, really just until i have some eggs fried or poached or however you want to do them 
bonus video recipe tip 
how to fry an egg in a cast iron skillet 
you have to use butter 
do not screw around with oil and frying eggs in a cast iron skillet 
i have no idea why it doesn't work, but it doesn't work 
you have to use butter 
i'm sure i'm going to get a million comments telling me i'm totally wrong, but in my kitchen, i have to use butter, or the eggs just stick, and they make a huge mess 
i'm heating this up over pretty high heat 
i'm going to let this butter kind of -- it'll get a little foamy, and then the foam will subside 
don't let me down, butter 
do what i said that you'll do 
okay 
i think that's hot enough 
it's sort of popping and stuff 
it's maybe almost about to turn brown 
that's good 
so, if you put it in, and it starts popping like that, that's good 
it means you're probably not going to have your eggs stick to the pan 
it also means you're probably going to get some little crusty brown bits, which i personally like 
but if you don't, then you might want to try poaching your eggs or not using a cast iron skillet 
just kind of shimmy it 
the handle will get hot, eventually, if you're frying a bunch of eggs 
so, don't have to be like me and be all stupid 
turn the heat down if it's popping too much 
so, it looks good 
the bottom's all set, white 
get it moving like this, and then boop, like that 
turn the heat off immediately, because that residual heat is going to keep cooking it 
so, it's not like totally done while i get my enchiladas out of the oven 
alright 
enchiladas are done 
oops 
i scrunched it, but that's ok 
it's going to taste awesome 
then, i'm going to cover it with a, hopefully, still runny egg 
come on 
i'll just do that 
perfect 
okay 
there you go 
breakfast enchiladas 
i cannot wait to dig in 
i have many other enchilada recipes on my website and videos 
and also, check out my breakfast playlist, if you are so inclined 
let's just go ahead and see if the egg yolk is still runny 
hey 
it's not runny, exactly, but it's moist 
why does that word gross everyone out so much?
okay 
get all this good stuff 
i'm just going to take a big old honking bite 
god damn it 
if i can 
fork 
my fork is traitor-ing me 
that is what i'm talking about 
this is what i want for breakfast if i ever come to stay at your house, like impromptu like bed and breakfast session 
this is what i want you to make me 
okay?
