hi 
i'm jamie eason 
welcome to the bodybuilding com kitchen 
today i'm gonna make my pumpkin protein bars 
i know i've been making a whole lot of different types of protein bars, but i don't want you to get burned out so i've got this brand new one 
this one actually makes a larger portion than the 8x8 we've been using so we're gonna get a bigger pyrex dish this time 
i've prepped this by spraying non-stick spray 
it's a 9x13, and i've also preheated the oven to 350 degrees 
so this one's easy because it's all in one large bowl 
see, first we've got 2 cups of oat flour 
again, oat flour is just ground up oatmeal, and you can buy it at the store in the healthy section 
you can make your own by grinding it in a coffee grinder or in a blender 
so i'm just gonna put that in 
two cups 
and then i've got 2 scoops of a vanilla whey protein 
you can use any flavor that you like 
for me, i just look for the fewer ingredients the better 'cause then it's healthier and usually it tastes a little better too 
so 2 scoops of that 
and then i'm gonna start putting in all of the flavoring ingredients 
i've got 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves 
cloves are pretty strong, but i think that's really what gives this its flavor 
so then we've got a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of baking powder and then 1/2 teaspoon of salt 
for my sweetener, i'm actually adding 1/2 cup of xylitol 
you can use the brown sugar blend 
you can use the regular 
i actually like the brown sugar blend for this recipe a lot, but you can't always find it 
this one is just the regular half cup of xylitol so put that in 
i'm gonna mix up these dry ingredients really well 
okay 
and then to this i'm gonna start adding the wet ingredients 
you can mix these in separate bowls if you like, but it's really not necessary so i'm just gonna put it all right in the same bowl 
first thing, i'm gonna start with four egg whites 
you can use the liquid egg whites if you like 
i used regular, real eggs 
i kinda like those better for baking, but it's up to you 
then i'm gonna add 1/2 cup of almond milk 
you can use whatever kind you want 
you can do regular milk 
you can do rice milk 
whatever you'd like, but i like the almond milk so 1/2 cup of that 
and then to that i'm gonna add one 4 ounce of the baby food applesauce 
you can use regular unsweetened applesauce at home if you have that 
put that in there 
it comes out to probably about 1/4 cup if you're gonna us the jar at home 
to that i'm gonna add my pumpkin 
i've used a whole 15 ounce can of pumpkin for this so you can use as little or as much as you want 
i really like mine really pumpkiny so i use the whole entire can 
make sure, too, that you pick the raw pumpkin and not the pumpkin pie mix that's loaded with sugar 
so put that in 
then my final wet ingredient is just 2 teaspoons of vanilla 
so i've got all of those in 
you can use the whisk if you like, but i don't wanna make a mess so i'm just gonna fold it all in with my spatula 
okay 
starting to come together 
and for this recipe, you can use nuts or you can do it without nuts 
i'm gonna put some walnuts in it 
i really like pumpkin and walnut together 
so i've got it all mixed up 
i've already put 1/2 cup of walnuts in a little baggie 
so the reason i've done this is because i didn't buy the crushed up kind 
i'm gonna actually crush these myself 
so i like to buy the ones from the bin 
usually they're a little bit more fresh than the ones that have been sitting on the shelf for a while 
so i just put them in a bag 
you can grab anything you like 
i like my little rolling pin 
just sort of crush them a little bit 
if you're worried about adding too much fat to your dessert, you actually don't have to mix them in 
you can put it all together and just maybe sprinkle half on one side or just lightly sprinkle them on top 
i like to mix mine in because i like there to be nuts in every bite, but it's totally up to you 
that's pretty good 
getting there 
maybe a little smaller 
alright 
now i'll just dump these in 
now the difference though--if you make it with or without nuts--with nuts, you're looking at probably about 67, 68 calories 
without nuts, you're looking at under 50 
it's about 47 calories 
so it's totally up to you, but the fat isn't that different and the amount of protein really isn't that different 
it's like about 4 grams of protein a bar 
this makes 24 bars, by the way 
so i've got that all mixed in 
and i'm gonna get my dish ready and just pour it in the pan 
okay 
i'll get it all spread out 
now this one you wanna bake it for about 30 minutes i would say, but it's totally up to you 
some people like the bars a little bit more soft, and some people like them a little more cooked through 
i suggest that if you're traveling with these, definitely keep them in the oven a little bit longer 'cause you want them to hold up 
put these in the oven 
bake it for about 30 minutes 
think that's right 
and then we'll check it in about 30 minutes 
always make sure when you're baking that your oven rack is like usually in the middle 
if it's too close to the heating element on the bottom, it'll burn 
and if it's too high up, it'll take forever to cook so we will check on it in about 30 minutes 
alright 
the timer went off 
let's check our bars 
alright 
they look good 
i'm pretty sure these are done, but if you wanna make sure you can stick a toothpick in it 
if it comes out dry with no wetness or anything, it's pretty much ready 
so i'm gonna let these cool and then we'll come back, cut them, and i'll show you how to wrap them up 
okay 
our pumpkin protein bars are fully cooled so i'm gonna cut them up 
let's see 
we've got--it's gonna make 24 squares so i'm gonna make 3 cuts lengthwise and 5 this way 
alright 
scoop a few of these out 
they look really good 
you can see some of the nuts in there 
and then i'm gonna wrap up the rest 
show you how i wrap them when i travel 
be sure to store these in a cool place like the frigerator because if you leave them just out on the counter or not in your cooler, they'll actually spoil 
there's no preservatives or anything in these 
i do them by twos 
i just place two on the saran wrap, fold over the one end, and roll it over, and then fold in the edges and--it's pretty simple 
okay 
i'm gonna finish up wrapping up the rest of these
