hi, i’m eugenie 
today i’m so excited because i’m making a delicious dish, jjangjangmyun,  which is one of the most popular korean dishes 
it’s a koeanized chinese dish 
for this recipe you will need:  pork, black bean paste, potato, onion, zucchini, vegetable oil, sugar,  cornstarch or potato starch, minced garlic, and oyster sauce 
first, heat a large deep frying pan over medium high heat 
and add in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil,  today i’m using grape seed oil 
and add in 2 garlic cloves, minced 
then add in 5 ounces of pork 
normally pork is used for jjajangmyun, and i am using pork tender-loin 
and season with salt and pepper 
and cook for about 4 minutes 
then add in 1 medium potato, diced 
i’m adding in potato first because it should be cooked thoroughly 
and cook for about 3 minutes 
and 1 medium onions, roughly chopped 
i know it’s a lot of onion 
jjangjangmyun at restaurants has a lot of onions 
but of course adjust the amount as you like 
and 1/3 medium zucchini, diced 
then stir fry for another 3 minutes 
and make a hole in the center of the frying pan 
and i will add in 3 tablespoons of chunjang, black bean paste 
without black bean paste, you cannot make jjajangmyon 
3 tablespoons 
and 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of sugar 
and stir to fry making a little circle for about 2 minutes 
this is very important because jjangjang means fried sauce in chinese 
and mix all together until the veggies are well covered 
hm, it smells good 
the fried sauce 
then add in 1 and 1/3 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of oyster sauce 
oyster sauce will give rich flavor to jjajang 
and bring it to a boil 
and in a cup,  add in 2 tablespoons of cornstarch  and the 2 tablespoons of water  and mix all togther until well mixed 
don’t add the cornstarch directly to the pan, it won’t dissolve very well 
ok, now add in the boiling jjajang sauce 
and bring it to a boil  and reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened 
and now for the noodle 
cook fresh noodle according to the package directions 
any noodles will do but fresh chinese style noodle is the best for jjangjangmyun 
and if you want jjangjangbop, just serve with rice instead of noodle 
and drain the noodle and wash with cold water 
be careful because it’s very hot 
voila!
and sauce 
jjajangmyon 
the noodle with hot jjajang sauce 
jjajangmyon is better with cucumber, danmuji, onions, and vinegar 
bon appetit 
this is why i love fresh noodle 
and black bean sauce is really intense and bold 
this is absolutely a must dish for korean food lovers and curious people 
and i have many delicious korean recipes in my “foods in korea” playlist 
thank you for watching 
see you soon 
bye
