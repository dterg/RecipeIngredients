this is stephanie manley with copykat com 
i'm going to show you how you can make a baked potato that's just like the outback steakhouse, with that wonderful salty crust on the outside, so let's get started and solve this mystery 
we're going to start out with baked potatoes, now use as many as you like 
now i'm using some that are roughly the size of my hand 
i'm guessing that's about a half pound 
you're going to need some kosher salt, which you can buy at your regular grocery store 
if you haven't tried it, it's a great ingredient to use for salt, lots of flavor 
we're going to use a vegetable oil 
it doesn't matter 
you can use just vegetable oil, sunflower, safflower, corn oil 
i would stay away from olive oil and peanut oil, simply because i think that can add a little extra flavor that i'm not quite looking for here 
now you don't need to pierce your baked potato with a fork or a knife or anything 
you're just going to dip a paper towel into a small container and just rub the whole potato down with oil 
we're doing this so the salt crust will stick on it, and this does another thing, as well 
it keeps the potato nice and light and fluffy in the inside, because we're not losing any of the potato's natural water, so it really works out well 
so by now you've preheated your oven to about 350 degrees 
it's heating away and it's getting ready for us 
the next thing we're going to do is we're just sprinkle on some salt 
now we're not going to wrap these in foil, because this could knock off a little bit of the salt, so that's it 
we're just going to sprinkle it with salt 
then we're going to pop it into our 350 degree oven 
i'm going to bake these until they're done, and for me that takes about an hour, so probably close to an hour for you as well 
go head, put these in the oven, and then take them back out 
let them cool for a little bit, but you can see the salty crust has remained 
these are wonderful, light, and fluffy on the inside, so i want to show you what this looks like a little bit closer 
how fabulous is that?
that's perfect 
i love the underside, because it browns just a little bit 
it gets a little big crispy on the bottom 
i don't think there's anything much better than that 
so here we go, here's our baked potato 
i'm going to go ahead and cut this open 
you can see again, the salt stays right on the top, to make it so delicious 
now i'm going to ahead and prepare this baked potato 
now of course, it's still screaming hot, so use a towel 
use something other than your fingers at this point, because burning yourself before dinner is never fun 
what comes next?
well, of course, we're going to top our baked potato with our favorite ingredients of our choice 
i'm a butter and sour cream, kind of girl, but as you can see these are really easy to do 
you just need a baked potato, a little bit of vegetable oil 
again, your choice is fine, and some kosher salt 
that's like the potato, the non-negotiable ingredient, and we're going to bake these 
they take about an hour in a 350 degree oven and that's it 
how wonderful is that?
so here we go, we're topping our baked potato with a little bit of butter, sour cream, and chives, and that's how you can make a baked potato, just like they do at the outback steakhouse
