hi, i'm eugenie 
today i'm making watermelon cookies 
those cookies are really easier than you think and it takes only several everyday ingredients 
it's basically a french biscuit sable recipe which is a slightly modified version of my french coffee sables 
first, in a mixing bowl, i will add in ½ cup of softened unsalted butter  and 1/3 cup of granulated sugar 
and whisk until light and fluffy 
and add in 1 egg yolk 
remaining egg white will be used later 
and add in ½ teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and a generous pinch of salt 
and whisk until homogenous 
now sift in 1 and ¼ cups of all-purpose flour and fold until combined 
now divide the batter into half 
first i will make red dough by adding some red food color and kneading 
this method is called 'fraiser' and you can mix without making the dough too tough with this method 
and make a 2 inch diameter cylinder and cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator 
then take out half of the remaining vanilla dough and cover with plastic wrap 
then roll out 
and chill in the refrigerator 
and with the remaining dough make a green dough 
today i'm using both matcha, japanese green tea powder, and green food color 
and again i will knead until homogenous and cover with plastic wrap 
then roll out 
and chill in the refrigerator 
now bring red dough and vanilla dough to working surface 
measure the size of the red cylinder and cut out the sides of the vanilla dough  and roll out to lengthen it 
and place the red cylinder over it and carefully roll up like a yoga mat 
now cut off the surplus vanilla dough 
repeat with the green 
by the way the cookie dough should be cooled a little before rolling, otherwise the dough will be too soft and won't hold the shape well 
now cover the dough with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for about 2 hours 
now make a colored sugar 
in a plastic bag, add in a little bit of green food color and spread with fingers to avoid any green color lumps 
and add in sugar and mix well until homogenous 
this is a simple way to make colored sugar at home 
and make a sugar bed 
then break one egg white and brush on the cookie dough 
and roll the dough over sugar bed 
french sable cookies need sugar decoration 
and slice the dough half inch thick 
and arrange the disks on a cookie pan 
and decorate with toasted black sesame seeds 
i love the mixed flavor of green tea and sesame seeds 
but if you don't have sesame seeds, use mini chocolate chips 
again i will chill the pan in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes  and then bake in the oven preheated to 350 degrees f  (175 c) for about 10-12 minutes 
out of oven immediately cut the cookies in half and let cool for 5 minutes 
then transfer to a wire rack 
voila!
watermelon cookies 
they are so so cute!
i love them 
it's french sable cookie style, so there are little cracks 
bon appetit
