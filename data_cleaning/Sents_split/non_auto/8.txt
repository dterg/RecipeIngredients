<transcript id="8" title="Fish Tacos Recipe |  Tacos De Pescado " url="Hey dudes, I'm Hilah and today I'm Hilah cooking" mode="non-automatic">
and remaking the second recipe video i ever did 
that is fish tacos 
can you believe it's been that long since i ate some fish tacos?
i mean, come on 
so, this is a great summertime recipe 
it comes together in a cinch 
it's nice 
it's refreshing 
it's light so that you can keep your beach body figure 
it's totally working on me 
so i'm really excited to share it with you, especially because that old video, the sound was totally f'ed up, dudes 
time to get hoppin' on the fish taco toppin' 
taco toppin' was actually the old aztec name for this 
so i'm going to update my slaw a little bit 
i've got some green cabbage that i shredded up, some white onion that sliced, and some jicama 
so this is a root 
it's starchy 
it has a texture like a raw potato, but it's sweet like an apple and mild 
so it adds a nice little flavor to the slaw 
i've got that in there 
and then i'm going to add some salt 
this is a super duper simple coleslaw recipe 
all we're going to use is salt and lime juice to get it softened up to get that cabbage releasing some water, and get it nice and tender so we can eat it raw 
everyone's on this raw diet thing 
whatever 
but some raw vegetables obviously are good for you 
like salad 
like celery sticks 
like carrot sticks 
so that's about a teaspoon of salt 
i'll get that tossed around with my tongs 
you could use your hands also, nature's tongs 
use a bigger bowl than i did so you don't have to worry about it flopping out everywhere 
so salt's coating everything 
now we're just going to squeeze in some lime juice 
and if you are be stricken by horribly high lime prices, you can use some lemon juice 
just don't tell anyone 
i really expected more juice from that lime, since i paid 33 cents for it 
hopefully that was close to two tablespoons 
we'll get that tossed around 
toss that salad 
and then i'm going to add some cilantro, or fresh coriander, if you are british 
and i don't bother pulling off the stems for cilantro 
i just chop it up really really fine because there's a lot of flavor in the stems actually 
so i can see with my little eyes that the cabbage has already started to soften up just with that little bit of motion in the ocean, so i'm just going to set this aside and work on some other stuff and just leave it at room temperature, and i'll show you what it looks like when we're done 
you'll be amazed 
you'll be like wow, you're a genius 
for the mayonnaise sauce, this is an update, i've got some mayonnaise here 
i'm going to add some minced chipotle peppers 
so chipotle and adobo, they come in a little can, it's a dollar, and it's the adobo sauce that's sweet and slightly vinegary, but mostly sweet 
and hot 
there's smoked jalapeno peppers, and then they're put in this adobo sauce 
so whenever i get a jar home, i like to transfer it into a jar and keep it in the fridge, and then they'll stay like that forever 
so they're pretty spicy 
i'm going to start with half of one and just mince it up, and it pretty much just turns into a paste as you're mincing it 
i'm just going to put all of it in there 
i like it spicy 
all minced up, it's about a tablespoon of chipotle in adobo 
plop that in with some mayonnaise 
lick your finger, because who cares 
i'm only cooking for myself and this guy, and he doesn't give a sh** 
i'm going to add some lime juice 
so about a tablespoon of that 
and i'm going to add a little bit of malt vinegar, which is really really good on fried fish 
it smells vinegary, but it's nutty and sweet 
anyway, if you can't find this, then you can just add some more lime juice 
it's just going to add some more tartness 
but also it's nice because of the whole fish connection 
then we're going to mix this up 
so the sourness of the vinegar and the lime juice should balance out the heat of the chipotle pretty well, but if it's a little bit too spicy for you, i would recommend that you add a little bit of honey or sugar to temper that heat a little bit 
but this tastes pretty good to me 
thumbs up 
so we'll just set this aside and start working on the fish 
so, i haven't changed anything from the original recipe as far as the seasoning and the spices that i'm putting on it 
so the two main things here are some cumin seeds and some anise 
this is not star anise 
it's just anise seed 
and it has a licoricey fennely flavor 
if you can't find it you can leave it out, but it goes really really nicely with fish 
and then whole cumin seed 
so those two 
and some chili powder 
and when i say chili powder, me, personally, i just mean ground up ancho chilies, or ground up new mexico chilies 
i don't mean commercial brand of chili powder that has garlic salt and all that stuff mixed into it, although if that's what you can find, and that's what you have in your pantry, that is totally totally fine 
please don't worry about it 
a little mortar and pestle 
you can use pre-ground spices if you want, but you know me, i like to make things hard on myself 
so put our whole spices in and crush them up 
good 
and then i'm going to add my chili powder 
it's already ground 
and salt and pepper 
what's life without salt and pepper 
you wouldn't have that song, push it, for one thing 
mixed up 
now for the breading part, i'm just using some cornmeal 
if you are in another country that's not the best country in the world, america 
if you are in another country and you don't have cornmeal, you can use fine polenta 
it's basically the same thing 
we're going to add this to that, and mix it around 
it's combined 
now we're going to do the fish 
so, i do the fish last so i don't have to wash my cutting board between 
i'm not getting raw fish juice on things 
i'm using some wild snapper, but you can use pretty much any lightish fish 
you could probably use salmon or something like that too 
any old kind of fish that you like 
and i asked the fish monger if he could skin it for me, so these are skinless and boneless 
so, i'm just going to cut them into pieces, maybe an inch wide by however long it is, so that usually ends up being about the right size to go into a taco 
so you got your fish chunks 
now we're just going to toss them around in this cornmeal mixture just to coat it 
we don't really need anything to help adhere the cornmeal, just the moisture from the fish will keep it on there 
and you can do this fish coating part ahead of time too and just cover them and leave them in the fridge up to a couple hours and then it'll help the coating stick on better too 
but you can leave them sit for awhile 
so the fish is all coated 
i'm just going to let it sit here in my little dish for just as long as it takes to heat up a skillet with some oil in it and then we'll get to fry in the fish 
fish fry party 
so you want to heat your pan up over medium, or medium high heat, and then add maybe two tablespoons of canola oil or corn oil or peanut oil, something neutral, with a high smoke point 
swirl it around like a lava lamp 
don't get all high and get distracted 
and then you want to cook your fish in two batches 
cook the smaller pieces with the smaller pieces and the bigger ones with the bigger ones 
and when you lay it in the hot oil, lay it away from you, just in case, so you don't splatter hot oil on your beautiful face and make jesus very sad 
so they'll probably just take about two to three minutes on each side depending on the size 
and with thicker filets like this snapper, you might need to do more than just two sides and go ahead and get the sides, sides cooked as well 
once they're nice and brown on every side we can take them out 
and when you break one open the inside should be flaky, like that 
and these are super duper hot right now so you want to let them cool off for a few minutes, and while that's happening we can heat up our tortillas 
put some of that on there 
some of our chipotle mayo sauce
