<transcript id="6" title="Egg Rolls Recipe |  Hilah Cooking " url="Hey, dudes. I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah" mode="non-automatic">
cooking, i'm making chinese egg rolls, which might more appropriately be called chinese-american egg rolls because they're a complete bastardization of original chinese spring rolls, i'm sure 
but anyway, these are great for snacks, appetizers, or even easter because they're called egg rolls 
get it?
that'll really throw your guests for a loop 
they'll be like, 'what the f-- is chinese food doing here with the ham?
' okay 
the first thing we're going to do is make our filling 
so, these have a precooked filling that you will cook it, and then cool it before we fill the egg rolls 
i'm going to add a little bit of oil to my pan and start sauteing 
i've got some super, very, very finely minced celery and onion here 
so, while that's going, i've got also here about a half a pound of ground pork 
you can use ground turkey, or you can leave out the meat completely and add some more vegetables if you want to also 
i'm going to add to this -- this bowl, i've got some brown sugar, some corn starch, and some minced garlic and ginger 
so, when you add corn starch to ground meat like this, it kind of helps lock in the moisture 
so the meat doesn't dry out, and it helps it sort of bind together 
so, it's serving two purposes 
i'm just going to mix this in with the ground meat here 
also going to add about a tablespoon of soy sauce to this and some pepper 
i'm going to use white pepper, but you can use black pepper or red pepper if you want it a little bit spicier, and a little bit of salt also 
i'm going to add a little bit of salt to these vegetables too, to draw some of that moisture out, to sweat them a little bit 
they'll soften up a little quicker 
and then, just get our meat mixed up and add that to the skillet also 
then, we just want to stir it around, break the meat up as much as you can, and eventually, it'll sort of come into really, really tiny little crumbles 
so, keep an eye on that and have a brew while you're waiting, because nothing goes with egg rolls like beer 
right?
you could also have water, but hey 
look 
tecate light 
i'm saving calories on my beer so that i can have more fried egg rolls later 
beautiful 
okay 
just a few minutes later, it looks like this 
i'm going to turn the heat off 
you just want to make sure that any big chunks of meat are sort of broken up 
you want, really, a very fine filling for these egg rolls 
then, transfer it to a plate 
you can use a baking sheet or something 
we just want to spread it out so that it cools off faster 
if there's any oil left in the bottom of your pan, you can try to keep that behind 
we'll use that to cook the cabbage also 
okay 
we'll set that aside 
then, back in the same skillet 
i'm going to add a tiny bit more oil, and we'll add the cabbage 
so, this is shredded napa cabbage 
i just sliced it really, really finely 
you can use regular old green cabbage too 
that'll give you more sort of texture inside your egg roll, and that's more common in restaurants 
i don't know 
i had napa cabbage 
so, i'm using napa cabbage 
either one is fine 
you can also add bean sprouts and things like that 
so, we're just going to saute this until the cabbage is wilted 
it shouldn't take very long at all 
okay 
so, cabbage getting nice and wilted 
we don't want to get it too soft because you want to keep a little bit of texture, and it'll still continue to cook, even after you've turned the heat off 
so, this looks pretty good 
the leafy parts are nice and soft, but the stemmy parts are still a little crispy 
so, i'm going to turn that off, and i'm going to add some water chestnuts 
these is just like -- these is just like-- a can of water chestnuts that i drained and minced finely 
and then, i'm also going to add some mushrooms 
these are dried shiitake mushrooms that i've just had soaking in water for about an hour 
wood ear mushrooms are, like those black ones that are really firm, are also commonly used in egg rolls 
these are a little bit easier to find, usually 
so, squeeze the water out 
then, i'm just going to mince up these mushrooms too 
and then, finally to this, i'm going to add a tablespoon of regular, all purpose flour and mix that in 
that's just going to help the filling stay kind of firm 
as it cools, it'll thicken it up 
so, it'll sort of make a mass that you can form into little egg rolls 
i'm going to spread this out on top of the meat mix 
then, we'll just put this whole thing in the fridge and let it get super chilled 
you can make the filling a day ahead of time, even two days ahead of time, which is muy excelente when you've had a lot of brews 
okay 
time to roll these mofos 
this is just about half the mixture 
it's cooled off totally 
these are my egg roll wrappers 
you can find these in the frozen section, usually, of pretty much any major grocery store 
you just want to thaw them out, and then keep the rest of them covered while you're rolling them so they don't dry out 
it dries out pretty quickly 
so, there's two here 
god damn it 
they stick together 
stick together like a hand in glove 
these egg roll wrappers are the best of friends 
okay 
it's going on my album, guys 
stay tuned 
stay ituned 
just kidding 
okay 
so, you want to get a big spoonful, maybe like a quarter cup or so of your mixture 
put it pretty much right in the center, maybe a little bit below the center, but pretty much just right on, bros  and then, roll the bottom up 
what i like to do is kind of take it over, and then pull it back 
did you see how i did that?
did you see how i did that?
so that it gets a nice little tight log 
fold this side over 
fold this side over 
then, in this little bowl, i've got just a mixture of plain flour and water, about equal parts, maybe a little bit more water 
it's not important really 
just use your finger to go 
i like to sort of get these sides here, like the envelope sides, and then the little point also 
this is going to kind of glue it together 
then, just roll it over like that 
just like that 
make sure that you have enough in that little tippy tip 
there we go 
so then, we want to set this aside, seam side down on a plate 
you can make these and let them sit for maybe, like, ten or 15 minutes tops 
but eventually, and pretty quickly, the filling, the liquid in the filling and the oil in the filling is going to kind of soak through the wrapper 
so, you can't really make them really ahead of time 
but like i said, you can make the filling ahead of time 
then, just roll up a few 
then, as you're frying the first batch, you or someone else, ideally you have a little helper, a little kitchen elf, will be rolling the next batch 
so, it's kind of a fun thing to do if you have friends that like to cook, to have them over, and let's all make egg rolls together 
you can make some different fillings 
you can put shrimp in them, or you could make vegetarian ones 
you could put carrots in them 
you could put whatever in them 
good 
so, i'm going to roll up about six of these while i start heating up my oil 
i've got some peanut oil in the skillet, just three-quarters of an inch or so, to about 365 degrees fahrenheit 
catch you on the flip side 
wait 
there we go 
cowabunga 
once your oil is around 365, you want to carefully fry your egg rolls in small batches for one to two minutes on each side, until golden brown 
now, we're talking 
be careful not to fry too many at once because the temperature will drop, and you'll end up with greasy egg rolls 
you'll also run the risk of over boiling your oil 
drain your egg rolls 
then, i like to put them in a bowl that's lined with a paper towel, sort of upright, so that the excess oil can drip off 
they actually stay pretty warm this way 
egg rolls are done 
what time is it?
it's egg roll time 
what time is it?
it's time for egg rolls 
those don't rhyme 
so, i've got here some oriental hot mustard powder 
you can find this in spice areas 
daisy, quit being such a bitch 
you just mix up the powder with water to the desired consistency 
i like mine a little bit thin so that it's good for dipping 
then, i've also got some sweet chili sauce 
so, if you like this egg roll recipe, also check out my chimichangas for another delicious fried treat with a mexican twist 
i also did fresh spring rolls recipe a couple years ago that aren't fried, and they're way healthier and almost as delicious

it's a fine crunchy egg roll
