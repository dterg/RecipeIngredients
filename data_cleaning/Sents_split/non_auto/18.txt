[music] hi, i'm jamie eason, and i'm in the bodybuilding com kitchen today, and i'm excited 'cause i'm gonna show you how to make my honey almond protein crisps 
i've showed you guys how to make chocolate protein bars, lemon protein bars, carrot cake 
they're all kind of, like, cakey, so i wanted something with a little bit of crunch, and this is super, super simple and tastes really, really good 
so let's get started 
for this recipe we're gonna need 3 cups of crispy brown rice 
we're gonna need 1 cup of whole oats 
we're gonna also need a scoop of vanilla protein, whichever kind you like 
we'll also need a fourth of a cup of chopped almonds 
you can either just use whole almonds and break 'em up yourself, or you can buy the chopped almonds at the store 
and then for our wet ingredients, we're gonna do almond butter 
we're gonna have honey, and this isn't actually wet, but it's gonna go in the wet ingredients 
that's our xylitol brown sugar blend 
this recipe is super easy, and it comes together really, really quickly 
all you're gonna need is basically a large bowl so you can dump all the ingredients in, and we need a smaller bowl so that we can actually just microwave to heat it up just a little bit, so that it's easier to actually mix into our dry ingredients 
and once you do that, it's pretty much done, and we stick it in the freezer 
no baking at all, and you can eat it in about 30 minutes 
to begin with, we've added already 3 cups of the crispy brown rice 
now, you can hopefully find this at one of your local grocery stores 
i've seen it at whole foods almost every time 
the reason i like this, it's gluten free 
it's really got very few ingredients 
it does have some natural sugar in it, but it's from evaporated cane juice and it's organic molasses 
so it's only got 2 grams of sugar per serving, which is 3/4ths of a cup, and we've got 3 cups in here, so you're looking at less than 5 grams of sugar for the entire batch, and you're not supposed to eat the entire batch 
so 3 cups go in the bowl, and then we've got 1 cup of whole oats   
so we're gonna dump that on top 
and then we're gonna add a fourth of a scoop of crushed almonds 
so you can actually do your own if you'd like and just use your trusty rolling pin and, you know, beat 'em down that way 
or you can buy 'em already chopped at the store, which is what we have   
so i'm gonna add a fourth of a cup 
and i kind of sprinkle it around, because we don't want to actually mix it up too much until we have the rest of our ingredients ready 
and the last ingredient for our dry ingredients is one scoop of protein   
so i'm putting that in 
and a lot of you guys always ask me, "what kind of protein do i use?
" whatever kind of protein you like 
i just like something that's got a good vanilla flavor 'cause it's usually a good base for everything 
and i always look for the fewer ingredients, the better, but whichever one you like 
some people like it with added aminos, and all kinds of extra little things so that they can get, you know, added nutrition in one little easy scoop, so all right 
i'm just gonna give it a gentle shake 
don't mix it up yet, because it'll all settle to the bottom 
set that aside 
and now i'm gonna start with my wet ingredients 
so we are gonna start with almond butter 
now, when you buy this stuff at the store, make sure that you're getting the one that is just almonds and salt, or just almonds 
don't get anything that has, like, added oils 
as you can see, there's a ton of oil already on top 
i like to pour off just a little bit 
don't pour it all off, though, because you'll have a really hard time mixing it up all the way to the bottom 
so i'm gonna mix it up just a little bit    and once i get that going, we are gonna need three-fourths of a cup of this 
so i like to use my one-fourth scoop 
i feel like it's a little bit more manageable, so i'll just pour that in    and we'll do that three times 
so i'll get that going 
i have my little rubber spatula to get it out   
i need three 
and now you can--one of the best parts of this recipe is that it's really whatever you want to put in it, so if you wanted to use, you know, peanut butter or tahini, which is crushed sesame seeds, or any kind of nut butters that you like, really 
you can use anything, and that goes for the nuts that you choose as well 
you can choose whatever you wanted 
so one more 
and as you can see, this is a lot of healthy fats 
you're forewarned at this point that this is not something you need every single day, but it's a great snack 
and we have actually an event tomorrow where we'll be running and burning a lot of calories, so this would be great for that, because it's great for energy 
all right 
and it's being a little stubborn, but i think we got it all 
okay 
so that goes in 
so we've got our three-fourths of a cup 
and then we're gonna need 2 cups of honey 
and honey, of course, will still spike your blood sugar, but honey is so good for you 
it's loaded with antioxidants 
there's all sorts of benefits to it   so we're gonna add that in 
again, this isn't for everyday consumption, but it's gonna be an awesome treat 
it tastes unbelievable, actually, for so few ingredients 
so we'll get that in, and one more   
there we go 
and actually, honey is kind of fun, too, because at the store, you'll find, like, all different kinds of varieties 
you might find one that's, like, lavender flavored 
i got one that was rose flavored once 
not so much 
i really felt like i was chewing on the lawn or something 
not good, so all right 
we got that 
and then to this, i'm gonna add a half a cup of xylitol brown sugar blend 
you don't have to use this if you don't want to, because you're fine with that amount of honey 
this will kind of kick up the intensity a little bit and make it a little sweeter 
i think it really adds a lot to it 
and it does add some calories, but unlike sugar, which is like 3 7 or something like that for sugar, this is only 2-point-something 
so it's less, and actually, it's approved for diabetics, because it spikes your blood sugar less 
so we're gonna throw that in there   but i do want to show you this one other alternative 
some of you may or may not be familiar with sucanat 
it's actually a brown sugar substitute as well 
if you taste it, it's really granular, but it does have a little bit of a hint of a molasses flavor added to it without extra sugar or anything 
so this is definitely an option for you 
so once we've put this in the bowl, i'm gonna put it in the microwave    [beeping sound] and we're just gonna do 30-second intervals is all we need 
and i'm gonna move this back over here, 'cause we're gonna need it to start mixing this together 
[beeping sound] sometimes it just takes one 
sometimes it takes a little longer 
i'm gonna actually go to the bigger spatula now 
actually, that heated it up pretty well   
mix it all together    and you really, you're just heating it just enough just so that it'll spread easily inside here 
i think that's actually pretty good 
if you needed to, you could do another 30 seconds in the microwave 
so i'm gonna go ahead and pour that in 
you want to kind of spread it out a little bit and get all of it out 
it's gonna seem like there's really not enough to kind of go around at first, but you just kind of have to really work it in 
so now i can start working it together 
i like to kind of use this little fold-over technique    so it doesn't stick to my spatula   all right 
so then you kind of start chopping into it 
now, you could actually add dried fruits if you wanted to, if this was for your kids 
you know, i know a lot of us stay away from dried fruits, but you could do all kinds of nuts, actually 
walnuts 
you could do peanuts, whatever you'd like 
all right 
i think we're looking pretty good 
i see a few dry spots, but i think i can fix that when it put it into the bowl 
so i want to use a 9 x 13 pyrex dish 
you can use whichever dish you'd like 
i just find that works well because i don't need to spray it or anything 
there's enough healthy fats in here that you don't have to add any nonstick sprays or anything like that 
all right 
i'm gonna grab my dish and pour this in    all right 
and you kind of get it started--i'll move that so you can see 
kind of get it started with your spatula    and then i like to finish it with my fingers 
i think it's easier to really get it pushed down in there 
so wet your fingers just a little bit   so it doesn't stick, and just start really pushing it down   
i could put the towel down underneath this 
it wouldn't be so noisy 
so i'm just really pushing it in good   and that's it 
and just so you know, one of my favorite things, actually, is you can use the same technique and actually use cookie cutters, which is kind of fun, and make like little shapes and stuff for the kids 
and now i'm just gonna put this in the freezer and then in about an hour to check on it    all right 
it's been about an hour, so i'm gonna go ahead and get the honey almond protein crisps out of the freezer 
all right 
it is definitely cold 
it's pretty hard 
so you can either at this point cut it into squares and sometimes, i don't even like to go to all that trouble, so i just break pieces off 
i recommend you store it actually in the freezer, because it'll keep the texture nice and hard, and it doesn't get too hard to bite into 
but if you cut it into 18 squares, each one is about 154 calories, about 8 grams, all of good fat, 21 grams of carbs, and about 4 grams of protein 
so i guarantee you will like this 
it's really good stuff, and i hope you will come back next time whenever i'm making something new
