hi, i'm eugenie 
do you eat rainbows?
today i'm making rainbow sushi rice cake 
it's totally healthy and very yummy 
if you make savory cakes, try this 
for this recipe you will need:  cooked short-grain rice,  rice vinegar,  optional sesame seeds,  mayonnaise,  canned tuna,  salt, sugar, onion,  pepper, red bell pepper, carrot,  boiled eggs, broccoli, and red cabbage 
first, in a mixing bowl i’m adding 6 ounces of drained canned tuna,  1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion,  and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise 
and mix to combine 
this is for rice cake filling 
and season with pepper 
you can use crab or salmon salad 
if you are vegetarian, how about guacamole?
in 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar,  add 1 tablespoon of sugar  and 1 teaspoon of salt 
and stir to combine 
and pour it into the cooked short-grain rice and fold to mix 
be careful not to break rice 
i cooked 2 cups of rice today 
and if you want, now mixing in toasted sesame seeds would be great 
then equally divide the rice in 5 
and add one vegetable in each bowl:  3 tablespoons of finely chopped red bell pepper,  3 tablespoons of finely chopped carrots,  crumbles of 3 boiled egg yolks,  3 tablespoons of finely chopped broccoli,  and 3 tablespoons of finely chopped red cabbage 
i used blanched broccoli, carrot, and red cabbage for better taste, digestion, and color 
and mix well 
for vegetarians, how about yellow bell pepper or yellow pickled radish for yellow rice?
any other ideas?
leave a comment below 
then for a rainbow cup, make a rainbow in a glass 
first, violet 
and i will add tuna salad between layers 
then green,  yellow,  press down a little with a spoon to make it firm 
orange,  and red 
and for sushi rice cake, make another rainbow in a cup lined with plastic wrap 
this time i started with red 
and repeat the process 
voila, healthy rainbow cup 
and rainbow sushi rice cake 
aren’t they beautiful?
the colors of this dish is  so inviting
