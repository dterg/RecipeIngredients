hi guys, jillian beck here 
welcome to my kitchen 
today i will be showing you my thai beef salad 
it takes about, probably 20 minute to assemble 
it's super easy 
it's great for summer 
it's getting warmer out and i kind of tend to go with salads around this time of year, grilled proteins are excellent, the fresher, the better 
so this thai salad is amazing because it's got tons of herbs, a lot of favors, some grilled steak, which is always a winner in my book, and then a lot of great flavors that are very typical of thai dishes 
as you may know, i do like asian food and flavors if you've followed any of my other recipes 
i just think it's a really good way to add flavor without adding a ton of calories and fat and all that other junk that comes with like a lot of sauces and condiments that some other recipes call for 
so i've kind of pre-made things here so it goes by a little quicker for you guys 
i'll kind of show you what you're going to need for this recipe 
first and foremost, you need a lean steak 
i typically go with sirloin 
i'll trim the fat away from it or i'll go with a flank steak 
so we've grilled that on the foreman here 
if you have an outdoor grill, by all means use that 
in my apartment, we don't have a grill yet so i either go to my friends house to, you know, grill on the barbecue or use the foreman 
so i've gone ahead and i've grilled it to my liking, which is about medium rare 
so grill it to the temperature that you prefer 
and i've sliced it so about 4 ounces sliced for one salad 
we've got our mixed greens here, some mixed red lettuces and green lettuces and then we have our fresh herbs 
we've got basil, mint, green onion and cilantro 
so those are the components of the salad and i'm gonna show you how to make the dressing and then we'll put it all together 
so for the dressing what you're going to need is fresh lime juice, which i've already gone ahead and squeezed 
so we have 2 tablespoons of fresh lime 
we're going to add 1 teaspoon of low-sodium soy sauce 
so i'll go ahead and add that right now 
here we go 
and then we're going to use fish sauce and it's just a typical asian flavor 
you can find it in the asian market in most of your grocery stores and if you can't, maybe go to like your local asian market to find it, but it's a pretty strong flavor but it's good 
it's just a little goes a long ways 
so we're gonna put 2--yeah, 2 teaspoons in here along with the 1 teaspoon of soy and then the lime juice 
and then we're gonna go ahead and add lemongrass 
now you can get fresh lemongrass from the produce aisle and slice it and add it to the salad along with all the other herbs 
my grocer didn't have that so i went ahead and got the lemongrass paste 
so i'll go ahead and add that as well and we'll just do about half a teaspoon, just a really small squeeze of that 
and usually with asian dressings and what not, they--you need to add like a little bit of sugar or honey or agave for like the sweetness to round all the flavors out 
typically i have been using stevia in the raw so that's what i'm gonna use here today but feel free to use whatever sweetener you choose, if that's honey, if that's agave, brown sugar, whatever it is that you want, go ahead and add that to the dressing 
for me, i like i said, i just need it a tad bit sweet and so i've been using stevia in the raw 
so i'll just do like half a teaspoon of that as well 
and then i'm gonna mix all those ingredients up for our dressing and let the lemongrass dissolve a little bit 
and i'm also gonna add the green onions to the dressing as well to kind of soak up the flavors of that 
it smells really good, really fresh 
okay, so we'll go ahead and start to plate 
we'll just put the sliced steak on top of the salad here 
just lay it on there 
and you can actually garnish it with all these fresh herbs before you put the steak, but i kind of messed that one up but it doesn't really matter 'cause you're gonna mix it all together anyways 
so i'll put the mint and the basil and you've got your steak there 
and we'll go ahead and top it with the dressing 
pour it all over 
and if you want a little more spice, feel free to add like some red chili flakes would be really good 
chili paste would be good if you wanted to add that as well 
and then we're gonna garnish it with a little bit of cilantro on top 
so there you have it 
really simple, really fresh and easy but a ton of flavor 
and there you have it, my thai beef steak salad 
there you go 
i hope you guys enjoy 
thank you so much
