[music] [music] hi, i'm christine avanti, celebrity nutritionist and chef 
today i'm going to be teaching you how to make my world-famous 10-minute tacos 
but before i get started, i just want to give you a rundown on what the ingredients are 
so very simple, we're starting out with some grilled chicken breast, okay?
i'm going to be topping my tacos with some shredded lettuce, some salsa 
i'm gonna use a little bit of black beans and low-fat shredded cheese and just as a side, i've got some brown rice, okay?
we also are using white corn tortillas 
i love these guys 
i'm gonna garnish with some fresh lime and some cilantro 
mmm, so good, i love it 
and a little bit of avocado, a right?
are you guys ready?
i'm hungry so i'm gonna get started 
all right, so we're gonna start with a little bit of olive oil, just a teeny bit, just for some cooking, get that chicken cooked up 
i've got my pan on medium high 
just gonna let that heat up for a second 
every good chef loves to season with salt and pepper, and i know people are afraid of salt but i'm not afraid of salt 
i eat healthy all the time 
i exercise a lot so salt is not going to kill me or my clients 
if you have high blood pressure, then that's a different story 
so we've got some salt in there always gonna go with the base, fresh-cracked pepper 
this chicken breast--see, my husband seems to like this and guys really like this 
this is pre-made, store-bought, cut up chicken breast 
i'm not the hugest fan of that but if you're in a hurry, it's good just to buy chicken breast already cut up and made 
you can buy it at the grocery store, trader joe's, wherever 
so i'm gonna put my chicken in here 
it's about 4 ounces of chicken breast 
okay 
that's 4 ounces 
let me wash my hand really quick 
i'm sorry, guys, but you can't cross contaminate 
sorry 
so when you touch meat, you always want to wash your hands with hot, soapy water because cross contamination can be a problem in the kitchen 
i'm gonna season 
instead of using the packet of taco seasoning that's high in sodium and preservatives, i'm gonna use some fresh spices, just a little bit of paprika, just sprinkling 
you don't have to get out a measuring spoon 
this is some chili powder and it's gonna start to smoke, which i love 
some cayenne pepper, some crushed red pepper and a little bit of cumin 
cumin is a spice that you will see a lot in spanish and latin cooking 
we're smoking, whoo, hoo, hoo 
okay 
literally because this is pre-made chicken breast, i'm just gonna look it for just like a minute, just to get the spices on it 
and also when you heat a spice, that lets the flavor release so kind of fun, kind of cool 
smells good 
and i think that this chicken breast looks prettier with the spices on it 
all right, so i'm turning off my heat 
i'm moving my pan over 
let that cool off 
the spices are making me cough 
i'm sorry 
it's how it happens 
now, what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna get my tortillas ready 
now if you have a gas range at home, you just turn on your heat, kind of to low, throw the tortilla right over it 
you don't spray, you don't do anything 
just put the tortilla right over it 
if you don't have a gas stove at home and you have an electric stove, that little like coil-looking thing, heating element, as they call it, you can put it on that too, medium high, just make sure that it's clean and it's not like coated with like sticky like cream of wheat from yesterday or something 
and you just leave it on there and then i hope every healthy cook at home as a set of tongs because if you don't, you need to go by some 
they're like a dollar at target, okay?
go get yourself some tongs because you're gonna use those to flip over your tortillas 
you use them for a lot of things, but for this meal, it's for tortillas 
just get some fire on the--look at how pretty that is 
just like a martha stewart photo at the end of the day when i'm done with these 
we'll make them so pretty that martha will be proud 
okay, they're almost done 
and you know what?
if you don't have--if you don't feel like heating them on your heating element, on your stove, on your gas range, you can always just microwave them 
i'm not a big fan of the microwave but last case scenario--worst case scenario, go ahead and throw them on there 
this one looks like it's literally on fire, which is fine 
okay, so i'm turning all the burners off 
and i'm going to very quickly cut up my avocado 'cause that's gonna go into my taco 
and i just want to cut a lime 'cause we want a little bit of lime juice once we're ready to build the taco here 
and then i'm just gonna cut a tiny bit of cilantro 
chop it up real quick so we've got that 
now, these tacos, it's not super hot 
i can hold it with my hand 
it's no big deal 
i'm gonna take my chicken--look at this chicken 
it's gorgeous, a lot better-looking than that chicken i had before, right?
put it in there 
okay, it's a little hot 
ow 
okay, cool off, cool off, cool off 
i'm gonna put a little bit of--i'll put some rice in here 
i'm put some black beans 
it's kind of hot 
hold on, you guys 
wow 
i think i might have grabbed it too soon 
okay, so mental note, don't grab the tortillas straight off of the stove, give it a second to cool off 
i mean i'm not completely burning to where i need to go to the emergency room but i'm burnt 
it hurts 
okay, so there i'm gonna put a little bit of fresh lettuce 
i'm gonna put a little bit of fresh cheese 
how pretty is that?
there's one taco 
i wasn't lying when i said 10 minutes, kids 
ten minutes 
okay, put this bad boy on here 
more of my--hey, mr  avocado, i know you wanted to go for a ride, but i'll use you in a minute 
okay, more chicken 
again, look at this chicken compared to straight from the store, okay?
we got some quick here 
we kicked it up a notch 
thanks, emeril 
okay, and i just touched chicken 
all right, sorry 
washing my hands 
okay, a little bit of rice, a little bit of black beans 
it's not a ton, but, you know, it's enough 
some people like their cheese right up against the warm parts 
we can do it this one like that, put the cheese right there, a little bit of lettuce, some avocado slices 
and i've got some salsa as well so we can put some salsa on there when we're done 
give it a little bit of cilantro, little squeeze of lime 
simple 
we'll make our last taco 
this tortilla was really hot so i was giving it a few minutes to cool off 
i think we're there 
it feels good to me 
last little bit of chicken 
if you guys don't have spices at your house, like cumin, cayenne pepper, paprika, chili powder, you should go get some because it really makes food taste good, okay?
it makes food taste phenomenal and i think that we--not only do we like good-tasting food but, as humans, we eat with our eyes so we want the food to look pretty as well 
and just because it's healthy, does not mean it has to look bland and not fun, okay?
little bit of cilantro 
i'll do my lime again, yummy, yummy, yummy 
who wouldn't want to eat these?
that's what i want to know 
i'm gonna eat them 
so we've got three tacos, little tacos 
i mean these tortillas were pretty small 
they weren't that big 
you get a little bit of extra brown rice on the side for a little bit more carb 
these tacos are only about 10 to 12 grams of carbohydrate per tortilla, so that's why we're adding a little bit more black beans and brown rice to it 
you can put your salsa there on the plate for just prettiness 
and did we already give it lime?
i'm gonna give it a little bit more lime 
we love lime 
lime definitely helps the flavor and we're gonna put some more avocado 
here's the great thing about this meal, avocado is loaded with what we call mono and saturated fatty acids 
these mono and saturated fatty acids are good fats 
they've been clinically shown in several studies, one particular a yale study, that actually helped reduce belly fat by 33% in people who were dieting 
another study showed that mono and saturated fatty acids that come from avocado, our dear friend the avocado right there, were actually people who were eating the more of these good fats from avocado were losing more weight than other dieters that were eating the same amount of calories 
so it's not only about calories in versus calories out 
it's about what are your calories?
are you eating good fats?
are you eating lean proteins?
are you eating processed food?
if you're gonna eat a processed meal that's 400 calories versus a meal made of real food that's 400 calories 
trust me, the real food meal is gonna help your body get filter and leaner faster than anything else 
so i'm putting all my avocado on here 
put a little bit on our rice 
who says you can't have avocado on rice, right?
little bit more black beans 
i like to mix up my black beans with my rice 
i just think it's more exciting and more fun 
and here you go 
you've got my 10-minute tacos, 377 calories for this entire plate, 20 grams of protein, 50 grams of carbs 
you're good to go 
all right, i'm christine avanti
