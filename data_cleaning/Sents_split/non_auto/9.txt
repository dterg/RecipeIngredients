<transcript id="9" title="Greek Pasta Salad  + Tour of My New House! " url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFs5PSdZ7u0" mode="non-automatic">
hey dudes i'm hilah and today on hilah cooking, look, i'm in a brand new kitchen 
so long orange countertops 
hello, a brand new house with white cabinets and lots of natural light and looks like rich people live here 
so, i'm going to make some greek pasta salad today 
this is a great thing for all your summer time potlucks 
fathers day is coming up might be a nice thing to take out for that and then after we make the recipe, i'm going to give you a tour of our new house and tell you a little bit about this watermelon that i ate 
the first thing for the pasta salad is we need to cook some pasta and now, one thing i've been meaning to talk to you all about, i've got about a quart of water almost to a boil here 
you really don't need to use like six quarts of water when you're making pasta 
i wrote a big thing about water conservation on my website 
if you want to go read some tips about how to save water because it's our most precious natural resource 
i said that sarcastically but i mean it so, anyway, you need about a quart of water to cook two cups of pasta or 1/2 a pound which is what we're going to do now 
the reason that people tell you to use a whole sh** ton of water like that is so that the pasta doesn't stick together but as long as you're kind of standing here for the first minute or so while the pasta goes in and you can kind of stir it around a little bit and then it's not going to stick together 
so i'm going to add some salt to my water 
so, you basically just want to stir until it comes back to a boil which will take 30 seconds to a minute so you can put the lid back on for maybe 10 or 15 seconds to help it come back to a boil faster but don't walk off because it will boil over if you do that 
so, once it's boiling and you want to set the timer 
my pasta package said 9 to 11 minutes 
i'm going to split the difference which is ten and then subtract two, so i'm going to set it for eight minutes 
i did it 
so, i've got my green beans while that's boiling, i'm going to go ahead    you want to snap the little stem ends off these and i don't bother like snapping off the little string ends because i think they're kind of cute 
so, once you've got all your green beans snapped 
just chop them all into about one inch lengths 
i'm going to set them in this little bowl 
get them the hell out of my way 
once our time goes off which is just in about two minutes, i'm going to add the green beans and then let the pasta and green beans boil together for the last two minutes 
that's going to sort of blanch the green beans and let the pasta finish cooking 
then you just want to drain the pasta and the green beans and give them a quick rinse with some cold water you're not really trying to cool them off so much as you are trying to rinse off some excess starch so that they don't stick together 
we're just going to leave those draining in the sink while i get the other stuff prepped up so i've got some fresh parsley 
i'm not going to be too anal about like not leaving any stems behind 
no stem left behind 
just sort of pull off the big leaves and we're going to give it a rough chop 
so, just sort of wad it up into a little ball and don't cut your fingers, and then i've got some kalamata olives and i've already chopped up some sweet peppers and some tomatoes here, as you can see, you can buy presliced kalamata olives but i find that they get a little bit mushy so i like to buy the ones that are just pitted and whole and then i'm just going to cut them in half 
yeah, let's just cut them in half 
that's easier for everyone 
so then, we're going to work on the dressing so that's going to require a clove of garlic 
just get it minced up then in a bowl here i'm going to put this garlic 
see if i can do this 
this is stupid 
ta-da 
so i've got my garlic in a large bowl, i'm going to add olive oil 
about two tablespoons of that and then i'm going to add some white wine vinegar 
you can use red wine vinegar 
you can use cider vinegar 
so i'm going to add a couple of tablespoons to this and traditional vinaigrette is three parts oil to one part acid like vinegar or lemon juice 
i like mine a little bit more forceful 
i like my vinaigrette to really take control so i'm going to do one to one ratio but feel free to adjust it a little bit according to your taste 
get that kind of mixed up then some black pepper of course and some salt and the real kicker here, some oregano and that's what makes it greek 
i'm going to add a whole teaspoon 
get that mixed up 
now let me go grab the pasta, just dump that on in 
i'm going to use a wooden spoon so i don't hurt you're delicate ears 
sweet viewers 
so i toss this all around then we can add our other vegetables and whatever else you want to add to this 
cucumbers may be good too 
red onion, whatever 
have a pasta party 
so this is why too, when you're making pasta for pasta salad you want to undercook it just a tiny bit, take it off the heat just moments before it would be tender enough to serve hot because then once you cool it off and mix it with your vinaigrette it's going to absorb some of that vinaigrette and it makes it way delicious if it has some room to absorb some of that 
also, it would be really soggy if you cooked it completely before you did that 
so then once everything is mixed up together, cooled off, then we're going to add the last ingredient which you can totally omit if you are a vegan or you are some parmesan cheese instead too and that's some crumbled feta cheese 
just a little bit, couple of tablespoons there we have it 
we're done 
so, you could serve this right now at room temperature or you could refrigerate 
it lasts in the fridge for couple of days 
let me get a fork because i'm going to eat it 
so if you like this recipe i also did a potato salad last year so that's also really great 
i did coleslaw, like a vinaigrette coleslaw that's also good because it doesn't have mayonnaise so like if it's sitting out in the sun, it's not going to get all poisonous on you, kill your children 
da**it, that is good 
good as hell and i hope you try it 
okay, than there you go 
thank you so much for watching 
printable recipes are always at hilahcooking com 
but, hey, guess what, remember what i told you?
house tour time 
i'm going to take this pasta and show you around the house 
let's go 
here's the kitchen pretty much saw that already 
okay then after the kitchen there is this sort of nook, we've got our bar, some booze in it, some random sh** that we haven't figured out what to do with and then all of my cookbook collection 
you want to see my favorite cookbook?
it's this one 
it's the one i wrote 
okay, then here's the living room 
more books, some other artwork we don't know what to do with and then look 
world's largest dog bed 
the dogs really enjoy this couch 
chris and i usually just end up sitting on the floor because they are such space hogs 
just kidding 
we all cuddle together and it's really cute 
okay and here we went from about 1700 square feet to about 1200 square feet which is a way more manageable number, i think 
bathroom, so we're selling our old place and we're just renting this place 
this is the baby room 
guess what, guys?
i lied, i did not eat a watermelon 
i'm having a baby because i had sex 
okay, so having sex makes you have a baby 
so kids, listen up 
we're having a boy 
fortunately, the room was already painted this nice turquoise color and had these window treatments that totally matched our pee wee herman poster 
oh, also, the landlady left the crib for us 
so we were like, "dude, free crib 
" we have to get this place 
and, oh, prenatal yoga bolsters 
we're going to be doing so prenatal yoga that 
okay, this is where the magic happens 
this is where the baby got made 
not in this room but on this bed this is also where daisy can often be found and this is why, got wooden floors and we had to get rug over here so that daisy could get some traction so she could jump up on the bed in the morning and wake us up 
she was just slipping and sliding 
it was so sad and cute 
okay, so let's go look at the back yard and see if we can see the dogs doing something cute 
look how big my butt's getting 
guys 
"boom, boom, boom 
" looks like a godzilla butt 
well, that rug is slippery 
be careful 
oh yeah, so it's got a big old deck 
hey guys and it came with a swing set 
guys go be cute for the camera 
go run around and play 
so yeah, basically, there's our new house 
we moved because we're having a baby and i wanted a nicer neighborhood that we could like walk around in so this is really good 
we're still in austin but its way more central and there's like parks and little shops we can walk to, so i don't have to load up the car every time i want to take the baby somewhere and it came with a swing set and a crib 
so how can we say, no 
okay, that's it
