[music] hi, i'm jamie eason and today i'm in the bodybuilding com kitchen and i'm showing you how to make my chocolate peanut butter protein crisps 
in a previous video i showed you how to make my honey, almond, protein crisps 
but now we're gonna use two of my other favorite ingredients: chocolate and peanut butter 
so, let's get started 
the ingredients for our chocolate, peanut butter, protein crisps are three cups of a crispy brown rice, we've got 1 cup of whole oats, a scoop of a vanilla whey protein powder, we've got some crushed almonds, some peanut butter right here, some cocoa, and some brown sugar, and somewhere around here i've got my honey 
that's all you're gonna need, so let's get started 
to start i've put 3 cups of the crispy brown rice 
and just so you see 
you can have a reference 
this is the crispy brown rice i used 
it's gluten-free, organic 
it's got very few ingredients in it 
it does have a little bit of sugar 
it's natural sugar 
it's got organic molasses and evaporated cane juice 
but it's 2 grams per serving 
there's 3/4 of a cup in a serving, so you've got less than 5 grams of natural sugar in the whole entire recipe, so not bad 
it makes 18 servings 
so, we've started with that, put that in 
and then i've got my cup of whole oats 
i'm gonna put that on top 
and then i'm gonna add 1/4 cup of crushed almonds 
so, if you don't have crushed almonds, you can actually just take your own almonds, you know, scoop out 1/4 of a cup of those and just beat them with a rolling pin 
you can use the back of a pot, whatever you have 
and then, on top of that i'm gonna add 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein powder 
i kind of sprinkle that on top, spread it around a bit 
now, do not mix this up 
we don't want to make all of the protein powder settle to the bottom 
so, i just give it a gentle shake and then i'm gonna set it to the side 
so, now i'm gonna switch out to a smaller bowl and in this bowl--now make sure you use a glass bowl 
that's important because we're gonna need to put it in the microwave 
so, we're gonna start out with our main ingredient, which is an all natural, unsalted creamy peanut butter 
you can use chunky if you like, but the chunky actually doesn't seem to mix up quite as well 
but i have made it and it tastes really good too 
so, it's just your preference 
there's a lot of natural oil that comes up from the peanuts, so we're gonna pour a little bit of that off 
don't pour it all out though, because you'll really have a hard time mixing it up 
so, i'm gonna go ahead and mix it--see, it's already kind of hard 
let's see 
i have to get the muscle in there 
mix it up a bit 
alright 
and so, we're gonna actually take 3/4 of a cup of a creamy, all natural peanut butter and add that to the bowl 
so, i like to use my little smaller scoop 
i think it's more manageable, but you can use a measuring cup and just measure to 3/4 
so, i'm going to scoop it out and put it in there 
this one looks slightly chunky, slightly smooth, so i think i needed to maybe stir it up a little longer 
sometimes i've been known to heat it up a little bit in the microwave just to get it going, but--let's see 
so, we've got our 1/4 going 
do some more 
and you don't have to be super, super careful with the measurements in this actual recipe 
you can add a little, take away a little if you want 
i've actually figured out the ratios just to have just enough so you don't have to--they don't end up too dry, 'cause we want them to stick together a bit 
we're trying to make that crispy rice and everything kind of all come together, so that when we freeze it, it actually makes this crunchy, crispy, kind of granola 
i've almost got it all out 
this one's more challenging that the almond butter 
now, with that said, you could use the almond butter if you'd like 
and you can actually add extracts 
so, if you wanted to make say chocolate with like a little bit of orange--hint of orange or something or there's coconut extracts 
there's bananas--maybe chocolate, peanut butter, banana might be pretty good 
you could actually use little pieces of banana if you'd like too 
but they will get a little mushy and that'll make it not stick together as well 
so, use that sparingly or do the dried bananas 
but, again, that's added sugar, so just be careful about how much you're using, 'cause we're already using quite a bit of natural sugar 
next thing i'm gonna add is gonna be my honey 
so, we're gonna do 1/2 cup of honey 
so, since this is my 1/4 measuring scoop i'm gonna do 2 of these 
so, we've got one 
need my little spatula 
now, honey is really, really, really good for you 
i'm often asked about honey versus agave and if agave is better 
i personally prefer honey 
i think there's so many health benefits to it with the antioxidants 
and it's good for your skin 
it's a good antibacterial 
there's just so many great things about it that i'd prefer to use it, 'cause agave in truth it'll still spike your blood sugar 
so, be careful because a lot of times some of those labels can be misleading and make you think that that's a better choice, but it actually still pretty much does the same thing 
so, alright, we've got those two ingredients in the bowl and now i'm gonna add 1/2 cup actually of xylitol brown sugar blend 
xylitol is a sweetener 
it comes from like raspberries, plums 
it's a natural fructose sweetener 
and it's actually a sugar alcohol 
it does not have quite as many calories as regular sugar, but it still will have a slight insulin spike 
it's just a little bit better for you 
it is organic 
it is natural 
they actually use it in toothpaste 'cause it's good for our teeth 
so, i'm gonna dump that in 
and the brown sugar part adds a little bit of molasses flavor to what we're making 
if you really prefer, you can look for something like organic sucanat, which it has 15 calories per teaspoon 
so you're adding some calories, but it's less sweetness as far as like less grams of sugar, but it also tastes less sweet 
so, you might end up having to use more 
so, for me i just like to use this and just kind of eat it sparingly, so 
alright 
into that i want to add--let's see we've got vanilla 
i'm gonna do a teaspoon of vanilla 
and then i'm going to add my chocolate 
now, the chocolate the preference is up to you 
you can add a couple tablespoons 
you can add a lot of tablespoons 
you can use dark chocolate, hershey's chocolate, whatever kind you'd like to use 
some people like cacao 
you could use anything you'd like 
so, i'm gonna open that up 
let's do 3 of those 
i prefer for the recipe to use dark chocolate 
so, if you can find the unsweetened dark chocolate, i think that's probably your best bet 
so, i'm gonna stir this up just a little bit just to get the dry stuff incorporated a little 
and then we want to stick this in the microwave for just about 30 seconds just to kind of soften it up 
so, i can stir it all together 
alright, let's stir this together a bit 
you want to get all of the dry ingredients incorporated into the wet, so it's doing pretty well 
you might have to stick it in there for maybe another 30 seconds to really get it pliable 
i think i'm gonna do that with--when you add all of the cocoa and everything it's not quite as liquefied as one of the other recipes that we made like the honey, almond, protein crisps 
so, let me stick that back in for 30 more seconds 
don't do the minute all at once, because you could burn your chocolate and we definitely don't want that 
alright 
let's stir this together a bit 
yeah, that's much easier to stir 
so, now that i've got it all out, i'm gonna go ahead and pour that on top of our dry ingredients 
there we go 
now it's pouring 
it smells really good 
i could probably just eat the chocolate and peanut butter, but--let's see 
this one i don't share with my dog, 'cause she can't have chocolate 
so, i'm gonna fold the dry ingredients over the top 
i like to do the little folding technique, 'cause it keeps my spatula from getting too sticky right off the bat 
alright 
and it doesn't look like much 
you have to really work it to start getting all the wet ingredients incorporated into the dry 
so, it might take a little bit of work, a little bit of muscle 
so, i think i've almost got it all done 
if you can see the protein powder still in there, you've got to probably keep stirring, which i can 
so, i'm gonna keep going a second 
it might look a bit dry and you don't want to add a lot of liquid though, because if you do, it'll end up getting too soft and fall apart 
so, i think it looks pretty good 
now, we end up putting this in the freezer so it can get hard, but do know that after a while if you take it out of the freezer, it's gonna get softer and softer and it still tastes awesome 
it's just not quite the same texture, because of course the peanut butter and everything softens up a little bit 
so, i think we're good 
and i'm gonna show you first and foremost how i make like one of the shapes 
i brought just a little circle, 'cause that's a pretty easy one to demonstrate with 
and i brought a pan 
you don't need to prep your pan or do anything 
you can just use your little circle 
and then you just really you take a little bit in your fingers, push it down in there 
it takes a little bit of time, but it's really pretty simple 
and then you just want to firmly pack it in there 
and as you push it all in then just gently kind of take the little loop off 
you can see how it turns out 
turns out like that 
and when it hardens up, it stays that way 
and it's really nice you can pack them up 
you can stack them together and wrap them up if you'd like 
so, let me do another one of those 
you could maybe alternate flavors 
do one kind of crisp and then do a different kind of flavored crisp 
alright, so i packed that in there 
wiggle it a little bit and there we go 
so, i would fill up the rest of the tray and then stick that in the freezer 
and i'm gonna finish working on these 
whatever i have left i'm gonna put in here and then i'll come right back 
[music] okay, the chocolate, peanut butter, protein crisp has been in the freezer for about an hour, so we're gonna go take that out 
they look great 
i took out the ones that we cut into shapes 
so, now they're nice and frozen and solid, so 
if you are making this and you actually keep it in one big dish, it makes about a serving of eighteen 
for a single serving of these you're looking at 153 calories, about 7 grams of fat, 21 5 grams of carbohydrates, and about 5 6 grams of protein 
so, i hope you like them 
i hope you get creative and have a little bit of fun with it
