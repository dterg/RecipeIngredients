[music] i'm natalie hodson, and i'm here in the bodybuilding com kitchen today, showing you how to make one of my favorite side dish recipes and i call it death-by-garlic roasted asparagus 
and it's a really good side dish to go with chicken or tilapia and it even works great as leftovers 
i put it in a ziploc bag and use it the next day 
for today's recipe, this is a pretty simple recipe though we only use a few ingredients and i have everything here 
we are going to use fresh asparagus and use about 1 pound of asparagus 
they usually come in bundles like this 
and some asparagus is a little bit more thin and some asparagus is a little bit thicker and it doesn't really matter, you can use either 
we're gonna use fresh garlic and some garlic does come pre-minced but i prefer the fresh garlic 
i think it makes the recipe taste a little bit better so we're gonna just buy the garlic clove like this 
and then we are going to use garlic powder and just make sure that you get the garlic powder and not the garlic salt 
they look real similar 
they come in the same size of container but the garlic salt has quite a bit of salt added to it and the garlic powder is just straight garlic 
and then we are going to use extra virgin olive oil and we're just gonna use 1 tablespoon of this, so just a little bit 
and then some pepper and i have fresh ground pepper but you could--if you don't have the fresh ground, just regular black pepper will work as well 
and then we're gonna bake everything on a cookie sheet and line it with aluminum foil and i already went ahead and pre-heated my oven to 400 degrees 
so the first thing we're gonna do is line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil 
and this just makes for easier cleanup so that way, when you're done, all you have to do is take your aluminum foil out, throw it in the trash and it's really easy to clean up 
okay 
so then we're just gonna set this aside 
first, we just take our bunch of asparagus, take off the rubber bands and then just rinse this, make sure that gets nice and rinsed and then what i do is i like to keep the asparagus still in the bunch formation and you want to cut off the bottom about inch of the stalk and--because the bottom of the stalk is really tough and it doesn't taste good, it's not fun to chew 
so what i do is i just take a kitchen knife and i just cut it all at once so it's really fast and easy 
and you just cut off the bottom of the asparagus and then what you're gonna do is evenly distribute the asparagus over the cookie sheet 
the next step is mincing the garlic 
so garlic, when it comes in a clove, has an outer shell kind of like an onion and so what i usually do is just cut the end off just so it's easier to peel and then there's some stuff, i just throw that away and then there's--if you can see inside, there's a lot of little what are called garlic cloves, so you just take out--this recipe calls for anywhere from four to six garlic cloves and it just depends on how much garlic you like 
i usually--i like a lot of garlic so i err on the side of six but if you don't like garlic as much or as strong, then you could just do four 
and another thing too, if you don't like garlic, you could actually make this recipe even without the garlic and just use salt and pepper and it would still taste pretty good 
all right 
so i'm just gonna set this aside and we have six garlic cloves here 
now these still have kind of an outer papery shell on them 
and so you need to take that off 
so what you do is you just put the garlic clove flat on your cutting board, take a knife that has kind of a wider flat edge and you just go like this and you just hit it and what it does is it kind of crushes your garlic so it makes it really easy to pull but it actually, i found out, this one has two cloves inside of it so i'm gonna do that again 
and then it makes it really easy just to peel off the outer shell 
so i'm just gonna do this for all six 
i really like--i eat asparagus a lot 
i really like eating asparagus and one thing that a lot of people don't know is that asparagus is actually really high in folate and a lot of pregnant women are recommended to take folic acid which is the supplemental form of folate and so asparagus is really good for pregnant women too 
and asparagus is also a natural diuretic so if you feel like you're holding on to some water weight or if you're feeling kind of bloated, sometimes eating some asparagus can help your body rid itself of some of that water 
all right 
so your hands are gonna feel kind of sticky when you're doing this 
that's okay, that's normal 
one, two, three, four, five 
all right 
so since that original clove actually was two cloves inside of it, i'm gonna set one of them to the side 
and then i just throw all the paper stuff away 
sometimes it sticks to your hand a little bit 
i just rinse my fingers 
all right 
so we're gonna mince the garlic really finely and i'm just gonna do that with a knife 
we already took the outer shell off, the papery part, and i just put my hand on the top and i kind of bunch it together and then i just mince it like this and i just keep pressure on the top of the knife and i just kind of keep going back and forth and then what i do is bunch it back together and just keep mincing, just like this 
and you just want it really pretty finely minced because you don't want anybody to take a big old chunk of garlic 
they might not appreciate you for that 
so this is looking pretty good 
i would say that's about as finely minced as you want 
so i'm going to rinse my hands 
and then i'm gonna set this aside for a second 
and then what we're gonna do is put the olive oil on 
so i just use 1 tablespoon of olive oil 
now this recipe makes four servings and so each serving is gonna have less than a teaspoon of olive oil 
so i do--i like to measure it out because sometimes i have a tendency to use too much olive oil so i just like to measure it out that way and know i'm just using a tablespoon 
and i just slowly drizzle it over 
just like this 
and then what i'll do is i'll take either a spatula or even just the measuring spoon and i'll just sort of go like this just to make sure that the olive oil doesn't get wasted on the bottom of the cookie sheet and that it gets over all the asparagus 
so then what we're gonna do is we're gonna take the garlic powder so if you have thicker stalks you might not need quite as much garlic powder, but if you have more stalks, you might need a little bit more, if you have thinner stalks 
so i just sprinkle--this is 1 teaspoon and that didn't even cover half of it so i'm gonna do it again, 3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon 
so just gonna keep sprinkling and it looks like i'm gonna use the whole tablespoon for this recipe 'cause remember this is called death-by-garlic asparagus so it's gonna be pretty heavy on the garlic 
and if you don't like garlic, again, you can use lighter garlic or even no garlic and just use salt and pepper 
and then i'm gonna use some fresh ground pepper and this, i just kind of eyeball it 
you could probably use about a teaspoon, maybe 2 teaspoons and if you don't have the fresh ground, just regular black pepper will work 
and if you wanted to add some salt, you can, but i usually just don't add extra salt 
and then what i'm going to do is take my knife and kind of scoop the garlic onto the knife and then just evenly distribute this over the asparagus 
so i just take my finger and i just go like this 
now if you were to eat a raw garlic clove, your eyes would probably water up and your mouth would probably start to burn because it's really spicy but when you roast it like we're gonna do on 400 degrees, it kind of takes some of the spiciness out of the garlic and it makes it have more of the garlic flavor that we're used to 
so that's it 
all i'm gonna do is rinse my hands and then stick this in the oven at 400 degrees and i'm gonna cook it for 15 to 20 minutes 
so what i'm going to do is put this in the oven, set the timer for 10 minutes 
at 10 minutes, i'm gonna take a spatula and just kind of rotate the asparagus a little bit to make sure that one side doesn't get burnt or crispy and then i'm gonna put it back in the oven anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes 
and if it starts to look too brown, then i'll pull it out at 5 minutes 
usually i cook it for the full 20 minutes 
all right 
so we just took the asparagus out of the oven 
at 10 minutes, we checked the asparagus, just rotate it, make sure it wasn't burning and then at 15 minutes we checked it again and what i like to look for is to make sure that the garlic starts to kind of turn brown a little bit and actually at 15 minutes ours looked good so you can cook it 15 and up to 20 minutes but we took ours out at 15 minutes 
and then what i do is i just use my spatula and put the asparagus onto a plate 
just like that 
and this asparagus is a little bit thinner which is probably why we were able to take it out at 15 minutes too 
if your asparagus is a little bit thicker, you'll probably want to go closer towards the 20-minute mark 
and this looks really good 
i'm gonna clean up this super easy 
all i do is fold up the aluminum foil, throw it in the trash and this looks really good so i'm gonna try it 
and you can serve this warm or you can serve it chilled as well 
tastes really good
