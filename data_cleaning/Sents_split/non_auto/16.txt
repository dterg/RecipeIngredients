i'm natalie hodson here in the bodybuilding com kitchen showing you how to make frozen spinach cups 
this is a really easy--more of a tip than a recipe 
i use this to thicken up my protein shakes, and it's great because when you put it in a protein shake, you really can't even taste it 
now it does turn your protein shakes green so if you have an issue with the color of your protein shake then you can add a few blueberries to it and it turns it purple and then you don't see the green color 
spinach is a green, dark green leafy vegetable which is really good 
it's high in vitamin a and it is really high in iron and calcium as well 
so for the ingredients we're gonna use today, we're gonna use spinach and usually i buy between a 6 to an 8 ounce bag 
different brands have different sizes that they sell but just one bag of spinach 
and then water 
and here i have 2 cups of water 
and we might not use the full 2 cups 
what we're gonna do is add the spinach and slowly add the water until it's the consistency that we need 
and then you're gonna need a blender, and then we're gonna use a muffin tin pan as well 
and what we're gonna do is once we blend everything together, we're gonna pour the liquid into the muffin tin pan and then freeze it that way 
okay, so this recipe is really simple 
all you do is you put your spinach in the blender 
and i just take handfuls and put it in 
and you're gonna start by filling it about almost all the way full 
my rule of thumb is about 1/2 cup of water per 2 handfuls of spinach so i just kinda pour the water in 
there it looks like we used about 1 cup so we'll start with that and then slowly add water as we need to 
and then you just put the lid on your blender 
it's gonna be kinda loud 
alright 
so as you can see, it really blends down quite a bit, and so what i'm gonna do is actually add some more spinach 
and so we're gonna add the rest of our spinach in here 
and then we're just gonna keep blending it 
i don't think i need to add more water, but i'm just gonna kinda blend it 
if it gets too thick--you basically want it just like a liquid consistency, maybe a little bit thicker 
not quite as thick as a milkshake consistency 
alright 
i think this looks pretty good 
basically you just want it ground fine enough so you don't have big chunks of spinach 
and then what i do is i take this, and i just pour it right into my muffin tin 
and i usually fill these pretty much all the way full because what i do is, and i'll show you later, is i just use one in each of my protein shakes 
alright 
so it looks like this made about six 
and so we could double this if we wanted and make 12 and freeze all 12, but today i think we're just gonna make all 6 
i'm gonna stick this in the freezer and then just let it freeze for about 3 hours 
you can even leave it in there for longer if you aren't home after 3 hours 
and then we're gonna pop these out and put them in ziploc baggies to keep them in the freezer to use for our protein shakes later in the week 
so i just took these spinach cups out of the freezer 
they've been in the freezer for about 3 hours, and as you can tell, they're rock solid so you can do one of two things 
you can just let them sit on the counter for a few minutes until they're melted a little bit and you can pop them out or what i like to do--it's a little bit faster--is i'm just gonna run the bottom of the pan underneath some hot water 
alright 
that should do the trick 
and then what i like to do is just take a butter knife 
and obviously we're not gonna use all six of these spinach cups in a protein shake at once, and so i just take ziploc bags and i put usually three or four of the spinach cups in a ziploc bag and i put them in the freezer 
so that way later when i go to make a protein shake, i can just grab one out 
i also use these when i make smoothies, fruit smoothies for my 2-year old 
it's one of the few ways i can get him to eat vegetables 
so i'm just gonna pop the spinach cup out 
that's what it looks like 
and just gonna go ahead--it's a little bit messy, but you can just rinse your hands when you're done 
so i'll probably do three in a bag 
sometimes i try to fit too many in there and i can't get it to zip 
oops 
i'm gonna just put two in this bag and we're gonna save one to use in a protein shake today 
to make the protein shake, i like to use unsweetened almond milk 
i like to use the kind with vanilla 
just make sure you get the one that has 35 or 40 calories, and read the ingredient list because some of the almond milks do add sugar, and you wanna make sure it's the unsweetened kind without any sugar 
but if you don't have almond milk, you could also use water or regular milk 
i usually use about 8 ounces or so 
i just kind of eyeball it 
and then i'm gonna do one scoop of whey protein 
you can use these spinach cups with any flavor, any brand 
and then instead of ice, i'm gonna use my frozen spinach cup 
and then what it's gonna do is it's gonna thicken up the shake and also add some good vitamins: vitamin a, calcium, and iron 
just gonna blend it up 
alright 
that looks pretty good 
and then i'm just gonna pour it into my cup 
so it does turn the shake a green color, and if that kinda weirds you out, you can add some blueberries to this and then it turns it purple 
and actually my son won't drink them if they're green, but if i add some blueberries and it turns them purple, then he has no clue and he drinks them just fine so--tastes like a protein shake 
you can't even taste the spinach at all
