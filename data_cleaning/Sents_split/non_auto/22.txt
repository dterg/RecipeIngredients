[music] i'm natalie hodson, and i'm here today in the bodybuilding com kitchen, showing you how to make one of my favorite recipes 
it's a strawberry banana oatmeal protein bake 
and i like to make this sort of as a healthier version of banana bread so if i'm craving banana bread but i know it's not very healthy for me, i'll make this instead 
and it's also a really good meal that you can make on the weekends 
you can make it in bulk and you can keep it in your 'fridge during the week or you can also freeze it so if you have to get out the door really quickly in the morning, this is a great item you can eat for your breakfast meal 
so for today's recipe, these are the ingredients that we're going to use 
and we have dry ingredients and wet ingredients that we're gonna mix separately 
so for our dry ingredients, we have 2 cups of old-fashioned oats and i prefer the old-fashioned oats to the instant oats just because they've been a little bit less processed 
the instant oats have actually been flattened, cooked and dehydrated and so the old-fashioned oats have just been rolled and they're a little bit better for you 
and then we have 4 scoops of vanilla whey protein powder 
you can use any brand you prefer, just keep in mind that the different brands will make it taste slightly different 
we have 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed and this is actually optional but flax seed has--is full of omega 3 fatty acids and they help reduce the ldl cholesterol, the bad cholesterol, and it's full of fiber and antioxidants so it just makes the recipe a little bit healthier 
and when you buy the flax seed, it comes in a bag like this, it's already ground, and you usually can find that in usually in the baking aisle of your grocery store by the other flours and things like that 
then we have 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon 
we have 1 teaspoon of baking powder, a fourth of a teaspoon of salt and that's just to help the baking powder rise 
and then we have a 1/2 cup of stevia in the raw 
and that's what i used for this recipe 
if you had truvia or xylitol, you can use that as well 
and then for our wet ingredients, i have a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce which is also 4 ounces 
this is the kind i got 
when you get your applesauce, you just want to make sure that you get one that says no sugar added or natural applesauce and the most important thing you can do is read the ingredients list so try to find one that the only ingredients are apples and water and maybe ascorbic acid and that's just vitamin c to help keep the applesauce from turning brown 
and sometimes i even--what i'll do is i get the little mott's containers that are for kids and that way it's like the perfect serving size and i have those in my cupboard for my son anyways and i'll use those sometimes 
so that's a 1/2 a cup and then we have 1-1/2 cups of unsweetened vanilla almond milk 
and i like to use almond milk in my recipes instead of milk because it's lower in calories and it has less sugar 
and this is the kind i like 
i like the almond breeze brand, unsweetened vanilla almond milk 
it only has 40 calories 
just be careful when you're buying your almond milk because some of the flavors add quite a bit of sugar so, again, just read the ingredient list and make sure that--like, this one has 0 grams of sugar in it 
and then we're gonna use a fourth of a cup of plain greek yogurt and this is the greek yogurt that we have today 
just, again, make sure that you're getting the non-fat plain greek yogurt 
make sure you don't get one that's vanilla flavored or any other flavor because they're gonna add a lot of sugar 
if you look at the back, it might have anywhere from 5 to 8 grams of sugar and those are the sugars that naturally occur in lactose so 
and then we're gonna use four egg whites 
i have my whole eggs here 
we'll crack them when we make the recipe 
and i have two bananas 
we're gonna slice these really thin and then we have four or five strawberries and you want to get big strawberries 
if they're kind of small then you can go five or even six 
and those are all the ingredients we're gonna use today in our recipe 
all right 
so first what we're gonna do is mix all of our dry ingredients together in a bowl 
so you're gonna take a larger mixing bowl and you want to put the dry ingredients in a larger mixing bowl because later we're gonna mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients 
so just put your wet ingredients aside for a second and then we're gonna mix 2 cups of oats, 4 scoops of protein powder, our flax seed, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of stevia in the raw, 1 teaspoon of baking powder and a fourth of a teaspoon of salt 
and then i'm gonna take my whisk and just make sure everything gets mixed together really well 
sometimes i have gotten lazy and not mixed it together very well and my baking powder doesn't evenly distribute and then when it cooks, half of it kind of is flatter than the rest 
so you just--you want to make sure that the cinnamon taste gets evenly distributed and the baking powder 
and just until you can't see any more, you know, brown spots or white spots, just until it looks nice and mixed 
so this looks pretty good 
so we're just gonna set this to the side and then mix together our wet ingredients 
and it doesn't really matter what order 
we're gonna take our almond milk 
put that to the side 
our greek yogurt 
and the greek yogurt just adds some moisture to the recipe and actually in any recipe you can substitute greek yogurt or applesauce for the butter and the oil in the recipe 
so now we're gonna put in our applesauce and just make sure you use a rubber spatula to get it all out 
and then we're gonna put in our egg whites 
now a little trick that i learned 
i used to just throw my egg whites in the trash can and for some reason, i could not figure out why, my house smelled bad all the time 
and then one day i went to go take out the trash and it was gross 
i could tell egg whites--or egg yolks were seeping through the bottom of the trash bag 
and my--we've realized that it was because i was eating so many egg whites and i was throwing so many egg yolks in the trash can and so now i just throw them in the garbage disposal so that way it doesn't stink up our house 
i know some people who have dogs actually let their dogs eat the egg yolks and it's good for their coats but we don't have any pets so i just do the garbage disposal 
there you go 
and last one 
you also could do the liquid egg whites if you wanted that come in a carton 
just make sure you use a little bit less than the ratio calls for when you bake 
and then i'm gonna take my--whoops--i'm gonna take my whisk and just mix this all together really well 
sometimes the egg whites can kind of stick together a little bit so just mix it until it looks nice and mixed 
then we're gonna bring over my mixed dry ingredients and we're just going to combine these 
and then stir it all together 
i have a 2-year-old and this is his favorite part 
i let him usually do this while i'm cutting up the bananas or sometimes i'll let him cut the bananas with me 
it's kind of fun to get the kids involved with this recipe 
it's also a really healthy meal that you could get your kids to get some whole grains into their diet 
all right 
so now that that's mixed, we're gonna prepare our pan 
let's move this to the side 
and we're just gonna use an 8-inch pie pan 
you could use a 9-inch pie pan as well and if you don't have pie pans you could even just use a square casserole dish 
and then just really lightly spray that 
you don't want to use a lot of this stuff but i just use the non-stick cooking spray 
and then just take your cutting board and we're gonna take one of our bananas and we're just gonna slice it really thin 
so take your knife and you just do pretty thin slices because you want enough banana slices that you can layer the entire bottom of the pan 
now sometimes bananas turn color after they've been exposed to the air 
and so i don't always but sometimes i've made this dish before and if i let it sit in the 'fridge for a couple of days, it kind of turns almost a purplish color so if that happens to you don't be alarmed 
that's not--there's nothing wrong with it 
it's just because the bananas, once they get exposed to the air, they can change color 
so now what i'm doing, is i'm just taking the banana slices and lining the bottom of the pan 
and after i'm done lining this, then we're gonna pour the batter on top of the bananas 
so this way, when you bite into it, you have banana taste on the bottom and then we're gonna put another layer of bananas on the top 
all right 
so this looks pretty good 
now what we're gonna do is pour the batter on top of the bananas 
and you just evenly distribute it there 
it's gonna fill the pan up all the way to the edge 
and then just scrape out the rest 
all right 
and then what we're going to do is slice our second banana and we're gonna do the same thing so we're gonna put a nice layer of bananas on the top and not only does this make it taste good, but it also makes the dish really pretty 
so the thinner you slice your bananas, the more you're gonna be able to put across the pan 
all right 
and this recipe makes four servings so one serving really just has one egg white, a scoop of protein powder and 1/2 a cup of oats plus a little bit of greek yogurt, a little bit of almond milk 
it does have half of a banana and a little bit of spices 
so this is a really good option for breakfast and if you are kind of getting tired of just regular old egg whites and oatmeal 
okay 
so i didn't distribute this very evenly so i'm gonna try and scoot some of these bananas over 
that looks pretty good 
then what i'm gonna do is take my strawberries and again, i'm gonna slice these fairly thin 
and you don't have to add the strawberries if you don't, you know, if you don't have them, you can just do the bananas 
the nice thing about this recipe is it's really versatile so you really could use any kind of fruit 
i've done this before with peaches and that was pretty good 
i've done it with blackberries 
you could do it with apples 
you could do it with raspberries, really whatever fruit's on sale that week, you could do it with 
raspberries would be really good 
and then i just put the strawberries on top like that and i did four--i did four strawberries or five strawberries and just so it looks about like that 
so that's it 
we have the oven 
i already preheated the oven to 375 degrees 
so i'm gonna stick this in the oven and we are going to cook it for about 40 to 45 minutes 
basically the top is gonna get golden brown and you know it's done once you put a knife in the center and the knife comes out clean 
all right 
so i just took this out of the oven 
we cooked it for 45 minutes and i'm just gonna test it to make sure that a knife comes out clean 
it looks pretty good 
and as you can see, the top of this is gonna be kind of a golden brown color and what i'm gonna do is let it sit here and rest for between 5 to 10 minutes just until it cools 
if i tried to cut into it now, it would all sort of collapse together 
so we're gonna let it cool and set for about 5 to 10 minutes and then after that i will cut it into fourths 
one serving is one wedge 
so i just usually just use a butter knife and cut through 
and then sometimes i like to take my knife and run it along the side just in case--just so it doesn't stick 
right 
then i'm just gonna take a serving utensil and pull out one wedge and there you go 
so what i might do is cut it in half again or just eat it like that so this looks really good 
i'm gonna try a bite and see how it tastes 
it tastes really, really good 
i think you'll be surprised 
this is one of my favorite dishes
