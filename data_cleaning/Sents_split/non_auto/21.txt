[music] hi i'm jamie eason and i'm in the bodybuilding com kitchen today to show you how i make my turkey meatloaf muffins 
[music] you're gonna need a large bowl for this, because we've got a lot to mix up, okay, but the nice thing is is just one big bowl for everything 
okay 
the first ingredient we're gonna need is a cup of quick-cooking oats 
so we're gonna dump those in 
then you've got all these ingredients that we're gonna mix in with it 
we've got 2 tablespoons of garlic 
now, you can either use the powdered version, or you can use the minced version 
i'll show you what--i've got it over here 
here's the minced garlic 
now, this one seems to be okay 
if you read the ingredients, it says, "garlic, water 
" it says, "phosphoric acid," and no preservatives 
so this one's okay 
you could probably use this as an option, but some of them, be really careful 
read the label 
they actually have oil in them 
it won't be real prominent 
it won't say it on the top 
so you've gotta really check out those ingredients 
this one's actually rare to be just in water 
so that's an option, too, but we're gonna use the powder 'cause it's just as good that way 
okay, then we've got 1 teaspoon of salt 
we've got 2 teaspoons of pepper, black pepper 
we've also got 2 teaspoons of a dry mustard    just dry, yellow mustard 
and sometimes if you're looking for dry yellow mustard, some people will not be able to find it in your standard jar, kind of like this one    you'll have to find it in sort of a box 
it looks a little bit more like the pepper, but it's in a darker box 
so i've noticed it's hard to find sometimes, and that's why 
and then we've got a half teaspoon of cumin 
cumin is a really smoky spice 
it's really good for you 
a lot of these spices are antioxidants so they're really good for you 
if you're not using a lot of spices in your food, you should start doing so 
and then we also have a half teaspoon of thyme 
thyme is used a lot in poultry dishes, whether you're making chicken, turkey, or anything 
and then our last ingredient is the one that makes the whole dish, so this is not the easiest to find, so this might take you a little while, but it's very well worth it 
it is 2 teaspoons of a chipotle pepper seasoning 
here's--let's see if i can find it 
here's what it looks like    so hopefully you'll be able to find that 
it does add some heat, so be careful 
if you're not big on hot things, then maybe only add a teaspoon and a half or something like that 
but i really think without it, they're a little more bland, so you definitely want the heat in there 
so that's it 
so i'm just gonna use my fingers and kind of get it all incorporated and mixed up   
this whole recipe is pretty much about using your hands, so all right 
that looks pretty good 
oh, and before i really get messy, i'm gonna take this off   
so put that to the side 
all right 
the next thing we're gonna need is going to be chopped onions and chopped celery 
now, this is pretty convenient 'cause it just comes in the package in your produce section 
i'm all about quick and easy, and this is what i'm gonna do 
i hate chopping onions, so we'll open that up    and if you were to chop it, you're gonna want to do a cup of everything, so quite a bit 
you know, you really can't overdo the vegetables, and if you're not a fan of celery, you can use red peppers, green peppers, anything you want 
but celery and onion seem to work really well for this 
but the more veggies you add, the more moisture there's gonna be in your dish, so overdo the veggies instead of under 
put that to the side 
all right 
the next thing we're gonna need is meat 
grab these over here 
for this recipe, you can either use extra-lean ground turkey, or you can use extra-lean ground chicken breast 
either one will work really well, and actually, even beef will work, too, so get that open   
dump it in 
and i'm using probably--i would say this is about probably about 2 pounds of meat 
so dump that in, and it doesn't have to be exact 
that's the great thing about this recipe is you kind of do it all to taste 
you just dump it all in and see what you get 
then the next thing we're gonna need to add some moisture is gonna be 3 egg whites 
if you're not concerned about adding any added fat, you can actually do a whole egg in there, but for this purpose, we're just gonna use the egg whites 
there's one   
egg number two    and egg number three 
now, before i really get my hands in there and get dirty, i'm gonna make sure first that i have my muffin pan prepped, and i've already set the oven to 375 degrees, so make sure you preheat it and that it's ready to go before you put them in 
rinse my hands off 
all right, so we're gonna prep this, because i don't want to have to stop it the middle with goopy fingers and do it 
so i'm gonna use my canola oil or olive oil spray, and that is 12 muffin tins 
it should make about 12 
sometimes it goes a little over 
it just depends on how big or small you make them 
okay 
you want to spray 'em pretty good just to make sure they don't stick 
and to save my pan, 'cause i hate when they get gross, i always, always, always wipe the excess off the top, 'cause they will get pretty grodey if you start making these a lot, which is what i do, because i always have these on hand and in my refrigerator, just ready to go 
you can actually keep this recipe completely frozen in your freezer and just take them out one at a time and microwave them if you want 
all right 
so that's ready to go 
i'm gonna set that to the side 
bring this back and get busy 
so take any jewelry off 
this is pretty cold   so all right 
starting to look pretty grodey, which is exactly what we want 
you don't want to over-mix meat too, too much 
you do want to make sure you get all the spices incorporated and lift it up and get all that stuff out of there 
if you over-mix meat, though, it tends to get a little more tough, so don't go crazy 
just get it all in there 
now, the nice thing about this dish, too, is that the muffin tins are what keep it in its serving size 
so it's all nice and portable that way, and it's got your carb and your protein all mixed in one 
now, it is a low amount of carbs, so you could still eat them in a pita 
you could add a few rice cakes or something to them 
every time i flip it, i'm still seeing spices, so i'm making sure 
all right 
don't want to over-mix, so i'll stop there 
all right 
now we're gonna put them in our muffin tin, and i'd say do about a racquetball size 
let's see 
that might be a little larger than a racquetball size, but not too bad 
we'll see how that looks 
sometimes you'll get all the way through and have to steal a little from the other one to kind of make 'em even out 
there we go 
you don't have to be perfect, but    another thing is that the fact that they're in a muffin tin, this is essentially just a meatloaf 
the difference is most meatloafs have, like, a ketchup base kind of in them, whether it's ketchup or tomato sauce or something inside of 'em 
we've kind of left that out and just put the eggs and a lot of veggies in there, so they're not quite as moist 
you can, if you want to, you can actually do what i call a thumbprint 
push it down in the middle and put like a ketchup or a barbecue sauce or something in them if you want to 
they get a little slimy and a little bit messy to take with you, so only do that when you plan to eat 'em at home, i think 
okay, we're doing good 
not looking like i'm overdoing it yet 
oh, the beauty of having them in a muffin tin, not only is that it's the right portion, but the moisture from the veggies stays confined in the little tins, so it tends to keep the meat from getting overly dry 
because, you know, extra-lean ground turkey has no fat really, so really kind of just gets overcooked pretty easily 
there we go 
exciting stuff watching me do this, i'm sure 
okay, it looks like i actually maybe have--i can make them a little bit bigger, so make the last one and then we'll add a little bit to a few of 'em 
now, if you were to cook these and measure them out, they would usually be about 2 and a half ounces each, so that will come to, you know, a pretty good serving size 
like, a male might eat maybe three or four of these, where a female would only eat two would be your serving 
and each one of these, depending on how large you make it, is gonna be like about 78 to 80 calories, or you know, maybe a little more if you do too large of ones 
these might be more like 80, 'cause i'm making 'em pretty big 
i think those packages, i didn't check the exact weight of them 
may have been a little bit more than 2 pounds, but that's good 
i'd rather have more than less, and these are really lean, so they'll be good for us 
so that looks pretty good 
rinse it off 
and so to continue with the macros, about 80 calories 
maybe like 2 grams of fat 
you're looking at 4 carbs and about 11 grams of protein, and that's for one muffin 
so you can get 22 grams of protein for 2 muffins 
all right 
these are ready to go, looking pretty good 
stick them in the middle rack, and we want to cook these for quite a while 
you never want uncooked turkey, and so depending on how hot your oven gets, i'm gonna put mine at about 40 
but you might have to play with that 
go a little over, go a little under, and just check them as you go 
all right 
so we've got 40 minutes to wait, so go watch a sitcom or something and we'll come back and check 'em 
all right 
i think these are about done, so check 'em out 
they're looking good 
let's pull 'em out 
they smell good 
i'll put down my potholder so that i don't burn the counter 
so they look pretty good 
all right 
now we just need to give 'em time to cool 
i suggest that you take them out a little bit before they're completely cool and put 'em on a paper towel 
i just fold it up on the counter and i put 'em on there and allow the juices that have kind of accumulated in the bottom to get a little bit dry, so that i can put 'em in a ziploc baggie, keep 'em in the fridge for any time that i just need to grab something to go, or just looking for something good to eat 
so hopefully you like the turkey meatloaf muffin, and hopefully you'll come back to bodybuilding com and check out more recipes with me
