this is stephanie manley with copykat com 
today i am going to show you how you can make ro-tel cheese dip in two different ways 
this is one of my favorite party foods to make 
it is easy and tastes great 
again, i said this is easy 
this only has two ingredients; the first being velveeta cheese and the next being a can of ro-tel tomatoes 
now the ratio is easy, easy to remember, it's one pound of velveeta cheese to one can of ro-tel tomatoes 
now i like to heat mine up on the stove, just because i think it's easier than pulling it in and out of the microwave, and stirring it and trying to make sure it's all perfectly melted 
this takes only about three to five minutes, and you will have some perfectly made ro-tel dip 
so again, there it was 
that took me about three to five minutes to make, and now i'm going to spoon this up and put it in a dish and get it ready 
so but you know what?
while this is really good, we can make this ro-tel cheese dip better 
so i'm going to show you how you can jazz up your ro-tel cheese dip; sausage 
you're going to brown a pound of sausage, so go ahead, and cook that thoroughly, because we are going to put this into our cheese sauce, so you want to make sure it is completely browned all the way through 
so again, i'm starting out with that same pot of ro-tel dip and that is one pound of velveeta to two cans of ro-tel 
i'm adding in sour cream, cream cheese and the next ingredient i am going to add in is that sausage 
that cooked sausage is going to go in here, as well 
now for the exact ingredients and recipe, please go to my website 
it's there i list it for you 
a little bit of garlic powder, and then i'm going to go ahead and stir this together a little bit, before i put in my pickled jalapeno slices 
i like to use the pickled ones, simply because they're not as raw-tasting, and i think the heat's a little bit more consistent 
so if you like your cheese dip a little spicier, hey, add some more or even add some of that jalapeno pickle juice 
you can see how that's rich and creamy and full of goodies, so hey, there's ro-tel cheese dip two different ways
