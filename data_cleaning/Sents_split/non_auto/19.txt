hi 
i'm jamie eason, and today i'm in the bodybuilding com kitchen, and i'm gonna make my italian turkey zucchini burgers 
i've already started by prepping my oven and setting it on broil 
you wanna set it on high 
there's high and low settings 
make sure you put it on high, and i've moved the rack to the top about 2 inches from the heating element 
i've also already grated my zucchini 
i'm using 2 pounds of turkey and for every pound of turkey, i've grated 2 zucchinis 
so we've got quite a bit of zucchini here, and it makes a lot of juice but we want that because turkey tends to be really dry so that's why we're putting the zucchini in there in the first place so it'll add some moisture 
so i want all of the liquid--as much as i can get 
try to balance that and get it in the bowl 
alright 
and then after i've added the zucchini, i'm gonna add all of my spices 
this is a really easy, easy recipe 
it's got 1 measuring spoon which is a teaspoon 
so i've got a teaspoon of pepper here, 1 teaspoon of garlic, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of oregano, and then 2 teaspoons of onion powder and 2 teaspoons of basil 
so that's it 
it's lots of green stuff 
and then i'm gonna add the turkey 
then this is where you get your hands dirty 
you just reach in and stir, mushing is out 
you never wanna over-work protein because then it can tend to get a little bit tough so just really kinda squish and pick it up and fold it over until you get it all incorporated 
you can make this same recipe with really any sort of meat whether it's beef or maybe ground chicken breast 
i actually prefer lean ground chicken breast but it's actually--it's really hard to find 
not every butcher makes it or every grocery store offers it 
it's looking pretty good 
now i've already prepped my pan 
i covered it in foil because this can get pretty messy 
the zucchini adds a lot of liquid so sometimes it gets a little runny 
you can make these on the grill if you prefer, but for me the broiler is just easy cleanup 
that's why i like it 
now i just need to form these into patties 
i get about a palm full, and you wanna aim for maybe about 4 or 5 ounces 
this whole recipe makes about nine to ten burgers 
this is actually a really great low carb option 
zucchinis are a carb, but there's very few carbs in them 
this recipe's also really versatile 
instead of burgers, you could make them into meatballs and put them on spaghetti squash and there's another low carb option 
for me, spaghetti squash is a lifesaver whenever i'm sort of in that low carb phase 
and something like this makes me think that--or makes me feel like i'm having spaghetti 
also, using the grater to grate up your vegetables and things like that, not only does it add moisture to your lean meats, but it adds more volume so even though it seems like maybe your--like for instance, if you're having a party or something and you've gotta make your dollar stretch, you can add lots of grated vegetables to things and it'll actually create more food 
so the more zucchini i were to grate up, if i only had 2 pounds of turkey, it actually might make more patties 
so it looks like i'm done 
i'm gonna rinse my hands off 
okay 
now i've just gotta get them in the oven 
with the broiler, you're actually gonna treat it just like a grill, and this one-- i usually like to do about 7 or 8 minutes on each side depending on how hot your oven is 
i'm gonna set mine for 7 minutes and then we'll open it, flip 'em over, and do 7 minutes more 
okay 
we've flipped the burgers, and it's been 7 minutes on one side and now 7 minutes on the other 
let's get 'em out 
they look good 
so you always wanna make sure it's done so we'll just kinda poke into one and peak 
no pink inside 
they're really juicy so that's a good sign 
and then i guess we'll just put one together 
you can eat them by themselves if you're doing the low carb thing or another option is to use ezekiel buns or any kind of bread you really want, but i prefer these 
they are only made from sprouted grains so if you look at the ingredients, there's nothing artificial in them 
you can only find them in the freezer section 
these are buns 
these are an english muffin which is another option 
and then you've also got just the bread so different ones have different calorie counts 
i think i'm gonna go for an english muffin 
you can toast it 
you can leave them soft 
whatever you'd like 
i'm gonna leave mine soft 
so then i've got my bun ready 
i'm gonna slice up a tomato 
done a few slices, a little bit of lettuce, and then whatever condiments you wanna put on this 
ketchup works or mustard might work 
i like the ketchup 
this is the reduced sugar variety 
just make sure you get one that doesn't have high fructose corn syrup in it 
so i'm gonna squeeze some of that one there 
i like quite a bit 
get a patty 
put that on there, and then there's my burger 
it looks pretty good 
alright 
i'm gonna take a bite 
see if i can get my mouth on it 
it tastes good 
alright
