eugenie kitchen hi, i am eugenie 
today i am going to make "soufflé à la vanille", vanilla soufflé 
soufflé, it puffs up in the oven and it falls down so quickly 
so, there is a famous french saying, “le souffle n’attend pas, on attend le soufflé ” that means le soufflé doesn’t wait for us, we (the guests) wait for le soufflé 
but today we will not wait for le soufflé, we will make  the soufflé 
for this recipe, you will need: 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (14g), 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour ( 10g), 1 /2 cup of milk (120 ml), 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons of caster sugar (30g), 2 eggs, and a pinch of salt 
first, with butter at room-temperature, brush the ramekins 
brush from bottom upwards 
this will make the soufflé to rise evenly 
then, with caster sugar coat the ramekins 
and shake out any excess 
and set aside 
on medium heat, add the butter in the sauce pan and melt it 
add in the flour and with a wooden spoon stir for about 1 minute 
in the microwave, i made the milk hot 
out of the heat, gradually add hot milk, and stir until smooth and combined 
back to medium heat stir constantly until it comes to a boil 
remove from the heat 
the texture should be like this 
this is white sauce 
now add in salt and vanilla extract and stir until combined 
separate the egg white and egg yolk 
then add in the egg yolks one by one into white sauce and stir to combine 
the sauce pan is still warm, so pour the sauce into a separate bowl to prevent unwanted evaporation 
and set aside 
now, whisk egg whites 
it is not mixing 
it is incorporating the air like this 
keep whisking until firm peaks form 
add gradually sugar while slowly whisking 
keep whisking until soft peaks form 
this is french meringue 
it takes about 20 minutes with hand 
then, add about one third of the french meringue into the white sauce and whisk until homogeneous 
then, pour all white sauce into meringue and whisk until just combined 
now, spoon the mixture into ramekin 
run thumb around inside of the rim 
this will help the soufflé to rise straight 
bake at 390 degrees f (200 c ) for 12 to 15 minutes or until very well risen 
immediately serve on a plate 
and dust with confectioners' sugar
