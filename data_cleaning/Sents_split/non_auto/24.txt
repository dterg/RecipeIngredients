hilah: hey dudes 
i'm hilah 
welcome to hilah cooking 
today, i have a very special guest who is the pizza expert and he's going to show you how to make homemade pizza at home 
all right, so here's brandon and him and his brother are from detroit 
brandon: yes 
hilah: and you all just started a pizza trailer called via 313 
brandon: correct 
hilah: because 313 is detroit's original area code 
brandon: that's so smart 
hilah: good 
all right, so we're going to make pizza today 
you all specialize in detroit style, so tell me about that 
brandon: well, detroit style is made with blue steel pans to make on a sicilian styled pie, but we put the sauce on top, caramelized cheese all the way around, and we get four squares out of it 
hilah: god, sounds yummy as hell 
brandon: and it's so good 
hilah: all right, but i don't have a pizza pan 
what do we do?
brandon: we're just going to make it happen with what we got in the kitchen 
hilah: sweet!
i love that 
awesome, let's make some dough 
brandon: all right 
hilah: all right, so we got just a few ingredients here 
it's not like it's that complicated it seems like 
brandon: it's pretty easy 
hilah: okay, cool 
so you all do use bread flour 
brandon: yes 
hilah: that's the key thing, right?
brandon: yeah, a lot better than all-purpose flour 
most people buy all- purpose flour and you don't get the same rise out of the dough 
hilah: okay 
and then we've got some dry yeast 
now is this what you all use in  
 
 
brandon: in the trailer we use active dry yeast, but at home instant dry yeast is a little bit better 
it's a little user friendly 
hilah: okay, all right 
so this recipe is a little modified from what they actually do so that we can make homemade pizza at home 
brandon: yes 
hilah: all right 
so i've got my stand mixer here and i've got a bread hook on this so we can use this for kneading 
if people don't have that, they can't just knead it by hand i guess 
brandon: yeah, be old school like that 
hilah: where did i get muscles?
brandon: yeah 
hilah: so we're just going to put all this stuff in and turn on the thingy 
brandon: yeah, that's pretty easy 
hilah: cool 
so we got our yeast and we're going to put it in with the flour 
stop me when i hook up 
brandon: i'll slap the shit out of you 
hilah: okay, cool 
salt and sugar 
and then  
 
 
brandon: so far 
hilah: so far, so good 
brandon: so far 
hilah: okay, cool 
and then oil in there too?
brandon: yeah, did all right so far 
hilah: thanks professor 
okay, and then i'm going to put this in here 
okay, and then what is it?
brandon: yeah 
hilah: and turn this on?
brandon: yes 
hilah: okay, so this  
 
 
well, now it'll just go and it'll start to kind of like  
 
 
brandon: yeah, it'll start to ball up and you'll be able to tell once it becomes one  
 
 
hilah: okay 
brandon:  
 
 
etc 
it's very loose right now obviously 
hilah: all right 
so we'll just let it go for a few minutes and then we'll come back and take a look at it 
brandon: yeah, i would say five to six minutes is pretty standard 
hilah: okay 
yeah, it's already changing, cool 
okay 
so it's been like five minutes or something 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: look at that 
brandon: yeah, it should be nice on the hands 
it shouldn't stick to your fingers too bad 
if it does, just throw some more flour in there 
hilah: yeah, we added maybe a couple extra teaspoons i guess 
brandon: yeah, just make it easy to handle for yourself 
hilah: okay 
now we've got some flour on our bitch as they call it in the restaurant 
brandon: yes, bitch flour 
yes, that's the fancy words for it 
hilah: it's just flour on the counter top 
brandon: this recipe should make enough for five or six pizzas 
hilah: okay 
brandon: you can cut it 
hilah: okay 
hilah: pizza party!
so i'll do six 
brandon: make it four 
hilah: make it four, okay 
brandon: so it'll be a little bit thicker 
hilah: okay 
wow, it cuts really nice 
brandon: yeah, it's got a nice feel to it 
hilah: and then what do you just kind of  
 
 
brandon: well, you can ball it like this 
pull it over like that 
you pull the sides and i'll pinch it at the bottom, and then make sure you cap it like that 
that's what they call it 
hilah: kind of like pinch it 
brandon: yeah, and then the other nice restaurant ball 
hilah: ooh!
cutsie tootsie 
brandon: you do another one 
i'll do another one 
hilah: okay 
brandon: i think yours actually looks nicer than mine 
hilah: i'm a girl 
brandon: that's what happens 
hilah: so then we'll put these in the fridge and that's an important thing that you all make sure to let it kind of rest over time 
brandon: yeah, i like to give it a good 12 or 24 hours to rest, gives it a nice flavor 
hilah: okay, cool, so start this a day ahead people 
brandon: yes, plan ahead 
hilah: okay 
well, this one's not quite as pretty 
let's use this one 
it's the prettiest 
brandon: yeah, thank you 
i did that 
hilah: i noticed 
and then i'll just kind of, i guess, a little oil in here 
brandon: yeah, throw a little oil in there so it doesn't still too bad and it'll be easier to handle tomorrow 
it won't  
 
 
hilah: stick to the  
 
 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: okay 
and keep it from getting like a dry out skin here 
brandon: yeah, obviously covering it so it won't dry out too bad, but hilah: all right 
so then we'll put this in the fridge and then i'll get you back here tomorrow 
brandon: i'll meet you tomorrow 
hilah: okay, cool 
brandon: maybe, i don't know 
hilah: well, if you're not drunk 
okay, so here we are again 
nice outfit 
brandon: thank you 
hilah: he did not spend the night here 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: okay 
so we got our raised doughs 
brandon: yeah, and what you want to do is kind of make love to it 
don't go in there and bang it all out 
just the more you mess it up the harder it'll be 
hilah: am i messing it up?
brandon: you're destroying it 
hilah: oh, god 
i am 
i'm sorry 
brandon: there you go 
hilah: okay 
because we don't want to like bust all the air out, right?
brandon: no, well again, the easier it is to handle right here 
hilah: okay 
brandon: so what you want to do is make a little crust 
so imagine a pizza on your table 
hilah: okay 
brandon: come on, get with it 
hilah: okay 
i was going to watch 
i don't make it 
brandon: no, make a little crust 
hilah: okay 
flip it over 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: and then  
 
 
brandon: keep doing it 
hilah: okay 
brandon: now, flip it over again 
all right 
you can push out the gas in the middle, but don't mess up the crust that you started 
hilah: okay 
yours looks better than mine 
brandon: now use your knuckles to stretch it 
just pull it apart and hilah: oh!
brandon: ah, geez!
hilah: party foul 
pizza party foul 
brandon: yes, you can stretch it about [inaudible that 
put your hand back and stretch it 
put your hand back, just pull it apart with your knuckles like that 
there you go 
that ain't going to tear on you 
hilah: okay 
this pretty cool 
brandon: yeah, i think this is the most intimidating part that people get a little freaked out about making pizza 
and if it does tear on you, just pinch it together and there you go 
hilah: okay 
just patch it?
brandon: yeah, just patch it together 
hilah: you did that on purpose  
 
 
brandon: i did that on  
 
 
hilah:  
 
 
to show us how to fix it 
brandon: yeah, exactly 
hilah: okay 
brandon: that's what i tell people 
hilah: cool 
brandon: keep stretching with your knuckles until you get about a 12 inch pie 
i think yours is pretty good actually 
round 
brandon: let's destroy it, so we can be done with it 
hilah: it's the pizza expert, okay?
brandon: yeah, i'm done with it and so that's good 
hilah: okay 
we just don't need one anyway 
brandon: that's good, yeah 
hilah: okay 
brandon: because i'm not hungry 
all right 
we can use that 
hilah: okay 
so now we put some toppings on 
brandon: yeah, so let's go ahead and put a little flour on this 
most people don't have these at home 
hilah: right 
brandon: you can use just a cardboard box and throw a little flour on the cart 
i'm not hungry 
brandon: geez!
a fucking shit show over here 
so no matter what you do it's going to lose its shape and form 
so once you get it on your cardboard box or if you're fancy and have a [inaudible restructure it to a nice round size 
i won't keep saying pie because most people here in texas don't call it a pie 
hilah: right 
yankee 
brandon: there it is 
hilah: just kidding 
welcome yankee 
brandon: i don't have ten years underneath from some [inaudible hilah: okay 
wow!
brandon: that's a good start right there 
hilah: that looks awesome 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: okay 
so we'll get some sauce and cheeses 
brandon: yeah, i don't know where it's at 
hilah: oh, you know what?
i made sauce 
brandon: where is it?
there it is 
it's a little easier if you put it in the center 
hilah: okay 
brandon: i put a pretty good mound in the center all the time and just kind of swirl it out into the crust 
you should be able to see where your crust was 
hilah: and i can see it on mine, yeah 
brandon: yeah, a little bit 
if you have an imagination just make it happen 
hilah: so we don't want to like saturate it 
brandon: no, just give it a good  
 
 
and sometimes it's better to put a little bit up at the top because it'll all kind of bleed through the center once it starts baking 
hilah: oh, okay 
a little heavier on the edges 
brandon: so i like to put a little  
 
 
yeah, a little heavier on the edges especially because the crust tends to dry out a little bit 
hilah: okay 
brandon: and then just let it kind of bleed through, through the center 
hilah: cool 
brandon: so that's the beautiful saucing 
hilah: awesome 
and then the cheesing happens next 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: all right 
we got our moz 
brandon: yeah, we'll do it together 
hilah: okay 
brandon: this is a whole milk mozzarella 
it bakes up a little bit nicer 
it's got a little bit higher fat content than like a kraft, a little moister cheese that you'd get at  
 
 
you know?
hilah: like pre-shredded kind of stuff 
brandon: yeah, if you want to be cheap 
it's like a buck more a pound, but you'll taste the quality 
it's already got a nice salt content so it'll pull the mozzarella flavor out of it 
hilah: yum 
brandon: again, kind of the same with the sauce 
with the cheese you want to put a little bit more around the edges 
hilah: okay 
brandon: not hit the crust, but let it kind of bleed through 
it'll all melt towards the center 
that's pretty good right there 
hilah: cool 
so we got our moz, now we get our pepps 
brandon: yes 
hilah: cool 
and this is some kind of  
 
 
brandon: these are natural casing pepperonis 
this is what we use back in michigan and we're trying to bring a little flavor back to texas from detroit 
these will shrink up, cup and charr 
we call them grease cups back at home 
hilah: mm!
i love that kind 
brandon: yes, but you don't find it around here too much though 
hilah: cool 
brandon: just whatever you want to do 
hilah: just get it on there 
brandon: who cares?
hilah: jesus 
brandon: whatever 
there it is 
hilah: show is over 
brandon: here 
just put some so it's not on the crust though 
but for real, these will melt, cook up nice, so whatever 
it doesn't have to be pretty because they'll do their own thing 
hilah: all right 
let's put it in the oven 
brandon: that's beautiful 
so again, we're using our fancy peel from the restaurant or the trailer 
we have a stone in here 
it's preheated about 550 degrees 
if you give it a good shake, again, if you're using a pizza box at home, you could use a little bit of flour on the box and just kind of give it a good shaking on there, make love to it, and let it do its thing 
it should take about ten minutes and it should be ready to go 
hilah: okay, cool 
if people don't have a pizza stone, what can they use?
brandon: a pizza stone, you can use just a regular aluminum sheet pan 
this cooks up real nicely 
you'll get a nice crisp on the bottom or as you said we could use a cast-iron upside down, make a mini personal pie 
hilah: a smaller one 
brandon: yeah 
hilah: cool 
brandon: but stone works the best 
they're only about 15 bucks 
hilah: awesome 
brandon: and a local art shop 
hilah: voila!
awesome 
okay 
brandon: now you're cutting it now so go ahead 
hilah: i have to cut it?
brandon: yeah, cut it in eighths, cut it in half 
hilah: okay 
brandon: just, you know  
 
 
hilah: my girl muscles are tiny 
brandon: put those mashed potatoes into it 
don't do that 
all right 
this is sad 
brandon: forget it 
so we'll cut it in half 
hilah: let's have a man do it 
brandon: yes 
hilah: okay 
brandon: i can't guarantee you get a  
 
 
hilah: so not like back and forth and sawing it 
brandon: no, don't do that because you'll have 18 different pieces out of that 
hilah: okay 
brandon: so this is what we have here 
hilah: cheers 
brandon: beautiful, cheers 
hilah: yay!
mm 
brandon: everything is good except for the sauce 
i don't know what happened 
hilah: oh, my god 
my mom did it 
that was weird 
brandon: i don't really know what happened with the sauce, but the cheese, the pepperoni, the crust, perfect 
hilah: dude!
this is awesome 
brandon: the sauce is  
 
 
hilah: wow!
dude, pizza party!
brandon: you guys can buy ragu at the store or whatever 
hilah: he's funny
