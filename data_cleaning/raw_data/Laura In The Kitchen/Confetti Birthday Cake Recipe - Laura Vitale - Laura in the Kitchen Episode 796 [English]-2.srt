if you love like wedding cake frosting

88
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,018
that about agree with it is just a

89
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,015
the a dream act opposite I

90
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:59,038
cakes baked for about 30 minutes now let
them cool completely on a wire rack and

91
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,115
I've done with one of them

92
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,040
they don't they're not cute don't
because remember we didn't add the egg

93
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,021
yolks we just have worked at the end
white

94
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:10,101
and fall the best comic the pavlova most
but where did I put on a

95
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:14,004
cake stand and then I just for a few
pieces

96
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:18,036
parchment paper around taught that the
cake then top doesn't get dirty ones I

97
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:18,088
go ahead

98
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:21,187
of day when make it really simple
buttercream and I'm really couldn't be

99
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:23,141
easier the first thing to do

100
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:28,069
as you need to start with paraffin
softened at room temperature

101
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:31,077
like that it's so so crucial you
absolutely need to be

102
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:35,093
at proper speech so to have here

103
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:38,151
a good amount of butter because again
this is parked free making this is my

104
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,059
standing mixer

105
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:43,116
because it easier it is to with with for
a long time so

106
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:47,103
gonna pop that and just add

107
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:51,025
some vanilla extract about tablespoon a
bit

108
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:54,078
that is a vanilla buttercream after all
and I'm scale

109
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:57,091
what this up until it just the butter
such got no

110
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:00,106
get selling have some concessions here

111
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:06,029
from holmdale for this highlighting

112
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:10,075
this year okay

113
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:15,103
lol so happy are they failed to mention
is just a small pinch of salt because

114
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:20,014
it all perfection show you what I know
is a lot but it is a buttercream

115
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:24,093
and just me Adelaide also out to cut all
the sweetness

116
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:28,109
it really does it's a great balance
understand add me sugar

117
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,027
trying to not get it all over the place
I think it's a pretty well

118
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:37,100
a/c well and then just a splash of milk
only couple tablespoons

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,059
milk and now I'm going to get this %uh
and get it going and mixing in this

120
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:42,130
could take up

121
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:46,024
10 minutes I mean buttercream goes from

122
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:49,119
St Sep crumbly for perfection

123
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:56,114

mixing but I mean look at that I so
fluffy

129
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:15,132
so worth the wait so

130
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:19,079
quite there yet again it's really rich
but I promise you

131
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,082
this is that once in awhile tree typical
wedding cake you don't hear very often

132
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,022
