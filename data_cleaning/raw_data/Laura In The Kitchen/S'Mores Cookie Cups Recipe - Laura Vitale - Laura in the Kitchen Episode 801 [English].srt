00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:18,088
Hi guys! I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode
of Laura in the Kitchen, I want to share with

2
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:21,146
you, a treat that I like to call my S'mores
cookie cups!

3
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:26,061
Now, I know they sound really fancy, but they
could not be easier and they are like the

4
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:31,123
perfect treat if you love s'mores but you
don't want to have a camp fire or have a big

5
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:37,069
elaborate fire outside and all that. These
are easy to make and are absolutely delicious!

6
00:00:37,069 --> 00:00:41,104
The ingredients you'll need are very few and
basic - and very simple ones especially if

7
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:46,009
you love to make s'mores, you might already
have these ingredients on hand, so let me

8
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:48,218
take you over them to get started!

9
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,299
You'll need some all purpose flour, baking
soda, some salt, some ground graham crackers,

10
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:57,317
I've got granulated sugar, brown sugar, some
unsalted butter that's really softened at

11
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,568
room temperature. I've got little Hershey's
bars, this was just little bars this size

12
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:06,387
that I just cut up into little squares. And
then I have some shredded chocolate which

13
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,640
I'll talk about in a minute, an egg, mini
marshmallows, and vanilla extract.

14
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:16,075
And that is it! Couldn't be any easier. Now
what did - I took a bunch of these little

15
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:20,167
Hershey's bars and I just separated them because
I needed like 48 little pieces. And then I

16
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:26,122
took some - because I need about 1/4 cup of
grated chocolate - and I just took a Microplane,

17
00:01:27,022 --> 00:01:34,022
you can use your box grater or anything that's
not as fine as a zester, and I just grate

18
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:38,130
it just like that. And I need about a quarter
cup so I'll leave the rest as my little treat.

19
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:44,062
Now, the first thing you want to do is get
your oven preheated to 375F, what I have here

20
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:47,185
is a mini muffin tin that I have greased with
some non-stick cooking spray, and you want

21
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,120
to get that out of the way.

22
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:52,080
And I'm just going to make everything in my
standing mixer just because it makes my life

23
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:53,124
a lot easier!

24
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:59,095
Now, in this bowl I"m going to add in my butter
that's borderline melted because I have had

25
00:01:59,095 --> 00:02:02,186
it on the stove while the oven was preheating,
so it started to melt a little bit, but that's

26
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,118
perfectly fine.

27
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,083
Both kinds of sugar.

28
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:10,175
And I'm just going to cream them together
just so that the sugar is well combined with

29
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,170
the butter.

30
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:19,101
That's looking great! I am just going to scrape
down the paddle attachment and just the side

31
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:23,143
of the bowl - side of the bowl, just because
I want to make sure everything is incorporated.

32
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:29,134
I'm adding in my egg and a good splash of
vanilla extract and then I'm just going to

33
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,036
mix this together until everything is combined.

34
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:38,112
Now what I did - I took some graham crackers
and I just pulsed them really well in my food

35
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:43,050
processor until it was like a fine powder
- that's what I want. So that's what I have

36
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:47,079
here and I"m just going to take a spoon and
mix all my dry ingredients together just to

37
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:49,030
give them a head start.

38
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,090
It doesn't have to be perfect because it's
all going to get mixed up anyway.

39
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:57,133
I'm just going to babysit this and get it
to - till it's nice and creamy and then we'll

40
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,097
add in our dry ingredients!

41
00:02:59,097 --> 00:02:59,129
Perfect!

42
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:05,838
Let's give it a little scrape-a-roo. And now
we are just going to add in our dry ingredients.

43
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,910
Very simple, kind of like you are making a
chocolate chip cookie, minus the chocolate

44
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:08,138
chips.

45
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:13,507
I'm just going to add my dry ingredients and
the grated chocolate, now you can totally

46
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,910
omit the grated chocolate if you want to but
it makes a difference!

47
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,620
And why you'd want to skip on chocolate is
beyond me - but you can omit it if you want

48
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:23,143
to.

49
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:28,048
Just going to let this mix until you - until
your dough comes together and then we'll be

50
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:33,232
ready to get these babies in the oven!

51
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,160
That is exactly what I am looking for.

52
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,090
It's at the right consistency for moi!

53
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,085
Now, I'm just going to take that out, I love
how it comes out really nice and clean and

54
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:45,137
effortless - which I love.

55
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:47,102
Push this baby out of the way.

56
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:53,059
And now, you can use a tablespoon, or I'm
just going to use an ice cream scoop - my

57
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:57,148
little handy dandy ice cream scoop that's
about the size of a tablespoon and I am just

58
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:04,387
going to take that and pop that into each
little muffin cup.

59
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:09,010
And once you have them all scooped out, you
just roll them in your hands so that they're

60
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:13,019
sort of into a nice neat ball, and then you
put then in your muffin tin.

61
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,047
Now, as you can see, I'm sort of pressing
them down. You can use whatever you want to

62
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:20,075
make an indent.

63
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:25,150
A rolling pin is not only my nonna's favorite
weapon, but it's also multipurpose in the

64
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:26,054
kitchen.

65
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:26,147
Haha!

66
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:32,386
The end of this rolling pin just works perfectly
for this - and I've made so many different

67
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:36,710
kinds of cookie cups, I make Nutella, I make
Oreo, I make pudding cookie cups - you name

68
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:38,115
it! And if you would like to see them, comment
down below.

69
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:43,834
But this works perfectly, so I just take the
end of my rolling pin and I just sort of press

70
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:48,042
it right in the middle and wiggle it around,
and you can see it makes the perfect indent.

71
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:50,777
I'm just going to continue to do that.

72
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,532
All around..

73
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:53,086
Perfect!

74
00:04:53,779 --> 00:05:00,779
Now, I'm going to pop these babies into my
oven that's been preheated to 375F, and they'll

75
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:05,015
be in there for about 7-8 minutes or until
the edges start to get a lovely golden brown

76
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,137
color and when they come out, I'll show you
what to do next.

77
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:13,108
My little cups were in the oven for about
9 minutes and now when they come out, the

78
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:17,043
middle kind of looks a little bit puffed up,
but what you do is you take the end of your

79
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:22,047
rolling pin or your spoon or whatever you're
using, and then you just reinforce that indent

80
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,149
that we made. So, we have those done.

81
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:29,848
These just came out of the oven, now what
I've done is I've turned my oven onto broil,

82
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:34,930
because I no longer need my oven on, I need
the broiler on. And I take a little piece

83
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:38,102
of chocolate - this is optional, but you know
- I love chocolate.

84
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,330
And then I take a little tiny piece - I usually
cut the little square in half - and then I

85
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:47,122
put that in the very bottom of each one.

86
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,240
Okay, now that you have that, you can add
a couple of marshmallows into each one.

87
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:57,603
I'm going to do, probably three or four marshmallows,
depending on how many I can fit.

88
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:01,907
I do like me some marshmallows though, so
I'm probably going to try and do 4 in each

89
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,798
one. Some might only be able to do 3 - yeah
because they are going to puff up as they

90
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,764
bake, so let's just do 3.

91
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,300
I'll behave.

92
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:15,202
Now, I'm going to pop this under the broiler
and just broil them long enough for the top

93
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:18,574
of the marshmallows to look like a light golden
brown color, and they do puff up a little

94
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:23,311
bit, only keep them in there for like a minute,
keep your eye on them because they can go

95
00:06:23,869 --> 00:06:30,110
from perfect to burned in a second! So, about
a minute should do the job, but just keep

96
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,560
your eye on them.

97
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,738
They look perfect!

98
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:41,430
Now you can leave them as-is because you do
have the chocolate on the bottom. But, I mean,

99
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:42,108
well, you know.

100
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:49,377
I just like a little tiny bit on the top.
Just so that it says the little Hershey logo,

101
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:53,456
that way you can tell it's kind of a s'more.

102
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:58,300
Once you have your little square of chocolate
on top of each one, allow it to sit for about

103
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:02,772
5 minutes. What happens is the heat from the
marshmallow starts to beautifully melt the

104
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:08,082
chocolate but yet the little piece of chocolate
stays in the same shape. But watch!

105
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,213
I'm going to take one out.

106
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:15,342
I'll use this one - comes out absolutely beautiful.
Look how beautiful, lightly golden that is.

107
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,427
But watch this.

108
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,002
You see how the chocolate is actually beautifully
soft?

109
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,990
Uh huh! Uh huh!

110
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:21,174
I know!

111
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:26,077
But it still looks like a bar of chocolate
on top, right?

112
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:31,099
I mean come on!

113
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:33,161
Mhmm Mhmm!!

114
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:40,066
I want you to see the layers.

115
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:46,850
The chocolate at the bottom, marshmallow,
the beautiful chocolate on top.

116
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,957
Just incredible base.

117
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:52,803
I quit!

118
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,110
I quit! ha!

119
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:59,058
I don't quit, I'm only kidding!

120
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:05,177
These are phenomenal. Such a cute little twist
on a classic s'more. I would absolutely love

121
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,860
for you to recreate this recipe and share
a picture with me on instagram, facebook,

122
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,735
twitter, whatever you prefer!

123
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,565
Nothing brings me more joy than seeing you
recreate the recipe, I hope you have enjoyed

124
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,130
spending time with me and I'll tell you what,
these will be the star of your next cookout

125
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,800
if you make these for dessert.

126
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:24,927
And the coolest thing about them in my opinion,
is that the top - it looks like a bar of chocolate

127
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,778
but it's melted and gooey and delicious.

128
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,381
Just do it.

129
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:35,030
Go to LauraintheKitchen.com to get the recipe,
hope you have enjoyed spending time with me

130
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,860
and I will see you next time!

131
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:37,094
Bye bye!
