4
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:29,073
there are so many variations you can
make and yes really

5
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,498
let me know if you wanna see different
variation and then this one

7
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:40,616
a jelly roll that's good strawberry jam
in the air and that's gonna be

8
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,050
with strawberry ice cream and mango
sorbet it but

9
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:47,404
nominal it looks incredibly can be
easier you could definitely take a

10
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:48,050
shortcut

11
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:51,096
by jelly were already pre-made but today
I think it'd they already have my ice

12
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,045
cream and sorbet

13
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:55,951
done we meet the jelly roll together
being green don't need to make the

14
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,620
actual jelly roll a very

15
00:00:57,062 --> 00:01:00,781
plain and simple wondering all purpose
flour baking powder salt

16
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:04,970
grain and sugar the bank that separated
into yolks and whites

17
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,099
now pay for you can use an hour extract
some milk

18
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:12,028
I went preheated 375 I'll to have 10

19
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:15,029
15 by 10 inch baking pan here

20
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:19,040
I've lined with parchment you want to
use spray with nonstick spray as well

21
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:22,086
because cam stick even to parchment
paper so

22
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:26,093
precaution now I'm everything in my
stand mixer just because it's really

23
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,170
easy in the first thing I'm gonna do

24
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:31,036
the National with the egg whites I'm
gonna take my way to put them in my

25
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,147
stand mixer mix restating mixers clean

26
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:38,052
and I just go with and other like coffee

27
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:45,097
like 50 family top

28
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:52,129
stately good needed to be skip actually
going to sleep attachment

29
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:58,054
now take my paddle attachment to finish
the rest the batter but first

30
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:02,085
I just wanna get the white out that I
don't eat them into the and I wanted to

31
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,119
do them first because

32
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,068
egg whites do not clear if you bowl

33
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:11,957
dirty cell a case like this a Mike Dunn
first and I think about the matter

34
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,170
that way to have to dirty up and another
bowl okay adding my

35
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:23,068
egg yolks and my sugar and now I'm going
to just put on my pal attachment

36
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:27,687
and crane pose together until the really
liked and KL

37
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,376
fluffy a couple minutes but doing a buy
and sell

38
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,430
let it go the I

39
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:41,137
the Alex excellent just gonna and an

40
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:47,084
a spoonful love my Penelope's by all
means you can use vanilla extract but

41
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:52,165

42
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:54,554
thank you her

43
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:00,530
lower the stamp mixed together my

44
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:03,132
flour with baking powder and assaults

45
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:06,656
and then up

46
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,126
along with now and i wanna

47
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,260
well as backup and I just think that
until it all come by

48
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:18,043
you want this to be fairly slip don't
over mix

49
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:24,084
otherwise here not as lucky

50
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:28,093
court just but we do have to kill
folding

51
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,430
the egg whites understand it up with my
spatula after that I don't deflate them

52
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:32,992
too much

53
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,379
trying to get all the batter of your

54
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,730
little better here or your power
attachment

55
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:42,622
as much as you can anyway I love to
always give

56
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,328
everything a good stir from the sides
and bottom

57
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,820
an ad in my egg whites do half

58
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,285
at a time so that I don't deflate them
and I think and work

59
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,905
quickly you can see I'm falling and take
my

60
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,230
spatula stick it right in the middle and
then you fold over

61
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,096
stick in the middle foldover that

62
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,583
such a gorgeous batter I love that you
can see

63
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,230
the bubbles from yet quite that's gonna
give you

64
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:15,202
really beautiful lights key

65
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:19,431
it I'll do my best Chiefland this is
from

66
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:23,620
s me they can manage with my spatula

67
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,111
don't panic if it's not perfect because
let's face it

68
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,880
no one will know the difference and I
just always biting around

69
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,998
the pan I think that just makes it
easier get as

70
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,240
evenly as possible excellent

71
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:45,062
this is gonna go into your preheated
oven to 375 for twelve to fourteen

72
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:45,133
minutes

73
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:50,071
or into what a lovely light golden color
in cooked all the way through them

74
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:54,152
is pretty finishing take that long from
the gate but that anasazi comes I will

75
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,011
show you

76
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,900
and the next make it completely cooked
they cooked for exactly 40 minutes and i

77
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,025
was just take a trip beginning with a
jockey

78
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:07,545
spaghetti they get enough parts there's
no what batter on

79
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,430
it's good now let it cool for about two
to three minutes no longer

80
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:14,050
maybe five now I have here a wind

81
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:17,017
free kitchen towel about the same side
as the cake

82
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:20,093
and I'm going to cover death

83
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:23,184
and from confectioner sugar because we
need to roll the up

84
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:27,783
so you wanna make sure that you
sprinkled with sugar and or if you get

85
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:29,552
on your counter

86
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,753
too early fine and now going to now I
did take

87
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,800
a night a butter knife n it just
releases really easily corrected

88
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:40,081
I am I did but if Greece that really
really well

89
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:44,162
I'm going to just in Perth this

90
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,750
just like that 6 do not panic

91
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:52,454
BC making sure that it's really name

92
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:58,145
and greased really helped and then I
just tried to straighten is better like

93
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,240
and now I'll call us around this by so
that you can think exactly what I'm

94
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:01,065
doing

95
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:04,090
about that now just you you fold

96
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:07,010
literally the tower in the cake shooting

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,289
shorting her story for one another stir
and

98
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:15,352
just roll this tightly but not too tight

99
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,924
just like that and that will take she a
a jelly born and this has to cool

100
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:20,516
completely

101
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:25,520
could take a couple hours something I
just placed on equalling math

102
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,081
allow it to cool completely and then
we'll move on to the next step

103
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:31,840
now I did I do have my ice cream in the
freezer already

104
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,650
against rubber ice cream and I have got
my mango sorbet

105
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:38,102
but I do know a great website our
internet com

106
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:42,071
we have to both recipes for you if you
wanna make them from scratch

107
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:45,590
or if you want a shortcut by the grocery
store the choicest

108
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,990
entirely up to you know that that's cool
completely and then we'll move on to

109
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,898
next

110
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:55,930
and this was calling for a couple of
hours announced going to

111
00:06:55,093 --> 00:06:58,128
I'm wrapping and don't worry if it can
look

112
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:03,056
walking because that you know you want
to do that want to go back into

113
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:07,121
same shape now a happier if some
strawberry preserves

114
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:11,046
you can use whatever preserve like I
mean it totally

115
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:14,140
up to you and what I'm doing it I am
just spreading

116
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:19,004
a nice then layer up there I'm not gonna
go all the way up because as I rolled it

117
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,070
will squeeze out

118
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:24,395
and as you can see there's some actual
pieces obstruct barry's here in their

119
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:24,523
cell

120
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,242
I'm gonna try and get this and even as
possible

121
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:32,240
kinda concentrating with leaving a cup
about an inch or so

122
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:35,383
I'm from all sides open because I get

123
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,590
again when this gets rolled ask us went
out what's

124
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,608
really fine but no one overdo it

125
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,870
this looks good enough and I want to be
too cubic

126
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,168
I think that looks perfect to me spatula
but

127
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:54,107
clearly a spoon works really really well
and now I'm going to just roll it back

128
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:54,724
up

129
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,560
this time you're not gonna roll beam

130
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:01,074
kitchen talent and Android just

131
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:04,223
like that

132
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:07,895
her and now I'm going to put this

133
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,030
she squirted a little tiny bit

134
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:14,077
we didn't pick you too much so sheet

135
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,976
okay many places here I'm going to just

136
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,050
racked this with some I'll up plastic
wrap

137
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:25,027
a little bit because I don't want this
to get through hard in the pocket into

138
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,105
the fridge for a half hour

139
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:30,046
or until it see knock-on effect on hold
shape

140
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:33,124
and then we will get ready to start
building are welcome

141
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:39,683
ice cream my Delhi bowlers in the fridge
for a bad hour now let me show you what

142
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:40,930
I have here

143
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:43,099
at a large bowl and don't worry about it
mention the measurement on every think

144
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:43,758
they will

145
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,230
right everything in detail on the on the
recipe and will be online to get him to

146
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:48,097
calm

147
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,155
and i'm taking a bow and headline that
well with some parts up with a plastic

148
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:54,066
bag ban on each other the plastic
wrappers

149
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,070
overhanging I have a small bowl

150
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:01,049
which I show you later I have got some
strawberry ice cream and left a

151
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:06,095
room temperature for out fifty-minute I
said you want this to be a little

152
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:09,129
often easy for you to work with nail to
have an orange

153
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,036
on argue that it's over ardent 28

154
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:19,074
echoing you the mystery knife I am going
to cut slices

155
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:23,106
on my jelly roll now cut them choo-choo
think actually

156
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:27,072
company would be will be better if I
just use this now I'm

157
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:31,101
I'm going to just cut my spices not to
think not to

158
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:36,022
then the bath I would say for half an
inch they could be a little bit less

159
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:38,073
than that

160
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:42,075
now I'm just taking slices up my jelly
roll and if you need to tighten them up

161
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:42,170
a little bit you can

162
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:47,076
I really do not do this in any
particular order I don't worry about

163
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,060
things looking perfect because the end
result

164
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,535
is just so too late for that it does not
matter

165
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,601
you just wanna make sure that you
covered fry

166
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,810
and the bottom up your bowl

167
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:03,104
you can cut them to fit to totally fine

168
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,603
just like taking a little bit my orange
juice in just drizzling

169
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:10,860
on the cake and keeps a little bit more
moist in some time

170
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:13,110
I'm be very honest with you depending on
one making its for

171
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:17,100
dependent on a year some time until it
agreed Monday

172
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,224
I'm doing a cherry base and although
cherry brandy

173
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,820
doesn't matter but today and using our
expertise aback

174
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:27,137
the ice cream should be softened enough
at this point because you do

175
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:31,436
need to be able to maneuver this around
the net looking

176
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,769
good benefit peeks through

177
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,863
little hole than that sparking just do

178
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,709
like and then you

179
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:48,870
gonna push it on the side

180
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:51,129
just like so try again and even as you
can

181
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,118
now show you are gonna do with Apple in
just a minute because the center

182
00:10:56,018 --> 00:11:00,026
is going to be where we put our mango
sorbet and not just yet analyze

183
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,060
everything we're kinda bland

184
00:11:01,006 --> 00:11:07,015
altogether I'm just going to do this and
even as possible as quickly as possible

185
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:10,658
good don't want the ice cream to melt
keep it clean

186
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,170
night take my ball but why make sure to
clean bowl

187
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:18,806
and you want to make sure that it's just
fit perfect

188
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,730
I'm not going to do it just like that
sorry if I'm moving a little fast but

189
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:26,147
arguing with ice cream okay now I'm
gonna do

190
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,141
I'm just going to cue rap aside like
this

191
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:35,041
pop this into the freezer for about an
hour or so or until

192
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,088
the strawberry ice cream is Foley for
then

193
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:42,117
again and then we'll be going quite a
lot by I know

194
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:46,041
now actually passed this into the
freezer overnight

195
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:50,082
at o'hare point-man what can I say girl
gotta do what a girl's gotta do

196
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:53,118
and also even better because I where you
can completely forget about a nigga

197
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,023
Nathan for than

198
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:59,107
now quick it it when you had a ball in
there it can be quite frozen so I do if

199
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,146
they take a kitchen towel

200
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,278
and I sort of right now one on the hot
water and

201
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,430
set my kitchen tile in the bowl for a
couple minutes until

202
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,079
it kinda starts shoot thought the right
the ice cream

203
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,144
right around the board just a little bit
and then it comes up super easy and

204
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:15,122
simple

205
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:19,701
now I have here some mango sorbet any
that room temperature

206
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,100

room temperature for a bit because I

207
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:25,098

and pliable

208
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:29,080
