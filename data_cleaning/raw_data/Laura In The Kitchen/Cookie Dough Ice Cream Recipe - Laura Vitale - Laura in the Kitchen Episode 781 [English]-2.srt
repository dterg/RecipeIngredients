19
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,081
cookie dough and then we combine
everything together is going to be

20
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:11,086
money okay let's get started so simple

21
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:16,088
a good large saucepan here in here I'm
going to add make repayment ok

22
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:20,145
and both were at the same time we think
of and tonight facts

23
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:25,214
and now an added a good spoonful love
the vanilla paste

24
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,640
you would need wanna vanilla bean

25
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:32,213
that you would scrape down and get rid
of erupting all the seen out on

26
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:36,831
bring here no means I'll but music know
the peso

27
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,200
and healthy spoonful that's sure to
check

28
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:47,731
just can't take this of you to put this
on my serve topped I like this come to

29
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:48,990
temperature to a simmer

30
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,572
over that medium-low heat now while my
milk mixture is coming to a simmer

31
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,110
I'm going to just take my egg yolks and
sugar with a little pinch assaults

32
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:03,078
am gonna with teeth together until the
mixture becomes really nice

33
00:02:03,078 --> 00:02:07,083
think and pay all collar actually looks
like when he gets there basically

34
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,457
essentially what we're making right now
is the I am

35
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,890
target the %um the unit nothing but

36
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:17,120
was all she became difficult to be is
just egg yolks

37
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:21,991
sugar delivered the news in a bit ago
but this needs to be with

38
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:25,261
implored really late and pay off and
about doubled

39
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,934
in volume actually looks like what if
they are keeping I

40
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,195
out on your milk mixture you do not want
to come to a boil because it does a will

41
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,110
flake

42
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:39,016
and then you have to start all over and
waste all that milk and cream and now I

43
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,078
so keep an eye on that in just a couple
minutes

44
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,397
and then you should be done sleepin egg
yolk mixture it

45
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,540
well and you're getting of the all work
at all while you're at it

46
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:52,148
i'm looking at the right temperature you
can feed as little bubbles are starting

47
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,197
to form around the edge up the pot which
is when I know

48
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:59,700
it and a perfect simmer by and get as
you can see I

49
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:04,015
texture this Anthony see kinda falls
down as on a ribbon

50
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:07,100
now that's perfect let 'em pretty egg
yolks by just taking

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,028
little bit I love my milk mixture just
about a half a cup or sell

52
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:15,407
and this is all doing is tempering the
egg yolk for that

53
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,400
they don't come in you don't get shocked
when you pour them into

54
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,028
the pan the hot liquid that's all you
need to do

55
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:25,148
going to now poor my egg yolk mixture

56
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:29,139
aimed shoot my pant very simple

57
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,558
just making it easy easy and very
classic

58
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,995
ice cream custard pink and now I'm going
to look at the color that

59
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,790
look at back collar just because they're
happy you have no idea

60
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,092
okay I switched back to my wooden spoon

61
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:50,441
and let cook this over about a low heat
until if they can really nicely and

62
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,322
coats the back of my spin

63
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,891
and I will show you what it looks like
one they are just make sure your

64
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,736
you keep this on a low heat and take
your time and be gentle

65
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:03,895
because of this comes to a boil or gets
too hot

66
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,790
it will split it want to split again you
will

67
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,090
no one is split and there is no going
back for just take your time

68
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,107
stir it like a figure in Figure eight
motion I like I'm doing right now

69
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:21,155
and then just be patient and when he
gets nice and thick you be able to

70
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:22,122
notice it

71
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:26,111
immediately my custard is ready

72
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,097
been cooking for about six minutes and
you can see it coming back a spoon if I

73
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,109
run my finger down

74
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,100
and Custer see separated you know if
they can a does it again he didn't act

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,044
with a path mister

76
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:42,061
save can't think Anthony eggshells
remaining or anything

77
00:04:42,061 --> 00:04:46,180
colonel whatever if they've backed it up
again to your final

78
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:50,120
mixture as you can see this is smooth
sailing

79
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:53,056
all the way that's how I like it

80
00:04:53,056 --> 00:04:56,080
I like it ice and snow there's really
nothing

81
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:59,040
maybe a little little tiny bit or
something remaining but for the most

82
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,091
part everything is really nice and

83
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,165
okay now you need to wrap this like
plastic back and you want to make sure

84
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,054
that the Catholic it actually typing

85
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,660
the surface %uh the custard on what are
they just forms are really weird looking

86
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,080
skin

87
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:17,937
that you don't want an eighth definitely
not gonna be smooth and delightful

88
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,050
want to go ahead and freeze there's
something a pop this into the fray

89
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:23,007
janiece to be in the fridge for about

90
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:26,564
four to six hours or best overnight
death

91
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,050
even better cricket but this is the free

day to day thought get to finish this

96
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:40,029

an can't while the custard if telling

98
00:05:45,086 --> 00:05:48,895

chocolate chip cookie dough batter here

99
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,370
and now if back travel to cookie dough

00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:56,056
bothers you because nothing net ne this

00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,074
eat raw cookie dough at some point in
their lives now if this bothers you then

103
00:06:03,074 --> 00:06:04,813
you might wanna skip this ice cream

104
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:08,960
on in its entirety can make my chocolate
ice cream you can make my

105
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,158
strawberry mint chocolate chip banana
whatever you want I got to recipes on my

106
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:12,137
website

107
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:16,116
but more time cookie dough ice cream

108
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,527
have actual cookie dough and that'll
make the so delicious I wanna make

109
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,263
like we would make chocolate chip
cookies but really easy and to do that

110
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:24,601
you'll need some

111
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,620
am all-purpose flour I'm going up into
thought that and got them

112
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:31,074
instance press a pattern you just a
small little pinch

113
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:34,128
found sugar granulated sugar some
softened unsalted butter

114
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:39,417
and egg but now axed after what I have
here are some chocolate chip type of

115
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,703
in my food processor something you can
see it got little bubbles at that time

116
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,009
there are bigger

117
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:48,620
I found a kind a whole everything I love
about cookie dough ice cream is that you

118
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:51,068
actually get bits and pieces of
chocolate chips or chocolate throughout

119
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:53,341
the entire ice cream

120
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,552
and I think this type of thing in a few
times in breaking the peace

121
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,000
a bit just give it a little more
interest and I think these AT PT almost

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,055
dust

123
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:05,044
like pieces I love the chocolate is what
makes this so divine

124
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,330
in my opinion so if you wanna skip going
up part by all means do that I think

125
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:13,392
crucial have to have a nine by 13 inch
baking pan here

126
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,702
Lancaster a big piece of parchment paper
cuz you wanna make sure

127
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,854
18 lifted up that setting aside so that
they got

128
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,237
I'm going to just came together make
butter and both kinds of sugar

129
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,470
gonna do this just a smaller balks and
feel like a

130
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:32,496
and getting my mixer africa is a small
batch just gonna make these two together

131
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,060
until combined

132
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:40,135
at the time did not have been added me

133
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,265

00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,072
have anyone that Kenny row and the one
not just

136
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:52,075
given a heads up the switch to my with
briefly

137
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:57,174
just kill mix everything together a
little bit better

138
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,960
just mixing together the coffee and
sought

139
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:03,124
adding any leavening agents this no
baking soda at

140
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:08,513
you need to me you know 8 yet cell them
make a difference in the put my egg make

141
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:09,826
sure you normally would put the dry

142
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,714
into my wet but I switchboard for some
reason

143
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:17,931
and our the flower was inevitable when I
just 1/2

144
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:23,900
to have room to make this together next
breath basically on doing I'm just gonna

145
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:27,081
combine this until it performs into a
Dell

146
00:08:28,062 --> 00:08:32,114
making at in can actually and my top it
now because it's almost there

147
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:36,036
time as well 101 overworked this anyway

148
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:39,071
had in mind chocolate chip mixture

149
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:43,115
in of add I'm take a bar of chocolate
chopped up if you want to that would be

150
00:08:44,015 --> 00:08:44,111
lovely

151
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:49,088
adding chocolate chips when you can add
me to check

152
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:53,140
but yes see what I mean when I say that
I think this is so much better because

153
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:54,059
that way

154
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:57,173

00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:09,069
cookie dough so that's why I like the
part of the NFL her little thing that

158
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:11,144

163
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:31,041
on doing in this is Camille little bit
tricky I'm trying to get this into

164
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:35,047
pretty thin layer because I'm only free

00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:43,078
said but co-lead you can see but I'm not
too worried about getting a perfect

167
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,110
and I want to be that way about it
either and it doesn't have to be all one

168
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,086
layer I'm just doing it this way because
it

169
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:51,118
easier till cut it when the prison

170
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:55,107
cell just gonna do that and I'm gonna
pop this

171
00:09:56,007 --> 00:10:01,015
into my finger how it for several hours
are a long it takes for the custer to

172
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,074
chill

173
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:06,096
caught the more frozen the better e65 to
chop it up from the happened fan

174
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,110
look I'm now the trust me when I tell
you it worked wonders

175
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:13,028
pop in the thin waiting for my culture
to can I think all

176
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:16,042
and I will go on and but all in all

177
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:20,140
machine and Daggett that much closer to
you but I don't think

178
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:24,091
by custard with in the fridge overnight
to what's going on in there for a few

179
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:29,043
hours but then we had my aunt over and
maybe a cocktail or two and we decided

180
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:30,057
to wait till tomorrow

181
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:34,065
ice cream which is good because it's the
weekend perfect time for entertaining

182
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:37,070
and ice cream now I have my ice cream
machine here

183
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:41,021
you want to make sure that the insert
the ice cream machine which is this guy

184
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,123
right here that's going up

185
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:46,050
basically for your ice cream for you is
frozen

186
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:49,037
now you wanna check always you
manufactures instructions because

187
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:53,082
every ice cream machine is different
when other one so my face to put in

188
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:56,166
there overnight to death to do it really
nice and solid for a sandwich it's

189
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,072
really important so make sure that you
read instructions because some I just a

190
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:01,107
couple hours

191
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:06,099
amor most the time will take overnight
so now I have my really cold custard

192
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,151
which is

193
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:11,088
absolutely fantastic I mean look at that

194
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:14,166
and this would be good on its own as it
is

195
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:19,125
I am over top maybe barey these or what
not

196
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:24,100
the poor that in the air get it all out

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,018
up now is how to turn this on now and
again

198
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:32,039
check the manufacturer's instructions
because it's gone but I'm gonna marry

199
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,121
mine takes a good 25 to 30 min you free
the ice cream

200
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:40,033
but there are also different some gonna
wait for this to be pretty much

201
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,059
virtually frozen and then we'll get
going on adding

202
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:47,093
our cookie dough

203
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:50,192
Ari my it exactly where I wanted about
25 minutes and now

204
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,104
gonna take my cookie dough the in the
freezer overnight

205
00:11:55,004 --> 00:11:59,019
as well which is what we want in this is
why did good on parchment because it's

206
00:11:59,019 --> 00:11:59,092
so easy

207
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:03,148
and now I just take a shark Night ending
no

208
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:10,106
particular way I just I'm gonna just
wrap this up into bite-size pieces that

209
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:11,595
is it

210
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,717
you ken you really can do in this

211
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,180
an a couple different ways of doing it
the way I'm doing it you can take

212
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:23,417
little teaspoons love the batterer we
know months you may get and then put me

213
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,540
on a baking sheet lined with parchment

214
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:30,093
and fried it that way and then that you
can just clip but the anti ice machine

215
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:33,587
I to do it this way I don't know why I
just think it's easier

216
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,060
and I'm get the job done a lot faster

217
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:41,205
and you can also leave certain pieces

218
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:45,353
bigger or smaller like that perfect so
now I'm just gonna go across

219
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:50,540
and Jess broth cha page

220
00:12:50,054 --> 00:12:53,123
on everything into that bite size pieces
and it

221
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:59,002
and do want to mention that it sounds
like this is really hard could it

222
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,241
its it's not it just sounds hard because
you were rough

223
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,610
you know cutting through chocolate I'm I
just want to mention that the as I'm

224
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,610
done there's something ken

225
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:10,960
you can hear the crunch for the crunch
is just because we're chopping up

226
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,870
the chocolate tell anyway figured I'd
let you guys know that act

227
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,796
announced and take the pieces in a you
can cut these as big or small

228
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,604
as you want and you can add as much or
as little as you want to

229
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,160
your cookie dough batter it's up to you

230
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,093
I'm gonna have no service but most
likely not all I think the from my

231
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:35,101
and of for people to served

232
00:13:36,073 --> 00:13:41,126
of recalled

233
00:13:42,026 --> 00:13:46,097
and this is money yeah buddy

234
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:49,115
now I only added about half a

235
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:54,019
the chocolate in cookie dough mixture in
here because I didn't want to add to

236
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:55,088
queue much because then

237
00:13:55,088 --> 00:14:00,090
you can also have a hard time with your
machine being able to handle

238
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:06,064
all that but look at this I mean and you
seeing what I'm seeing and also

239
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:09,120
are you see how those little rubble Dove
chocolate

240
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:13,023
kinda spread all throughout the batter
and that's from

241
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,052
when I took the chocolate pieces the
child chips and put them through

242
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,058
different processor kit that is
personally what I like

243
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:22,091
obviously you want big chocolate chips
here and there but

244
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:25,118
why have a little bit when you can have
chocolates row

245
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:29,030
are look at that I mean just if you get
up close you can see

246
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:33,012
that it's really creamy it's got this
big chunks

247
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,064
have cookie del I'm just to make myself
a little ask

248
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:39,068
okay path just just just scoop

249
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:43,074
just scoop on a town I am deserving

250
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:47,105
work 0 go to pieces

251
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:55,005
I'll mmm you love this

252
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,091
a promise you will love this

253
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,054
it's so easy in taste so

254
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:06,063
much better store-bought I cannot stress
enough I can sing the easy to do

255
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:11,049
doesn't take a hard time doesn't take
any fancying gradient that's very basic

256
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:11,188
but it done

257
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:15,091
the right where you can seem me it's
just

258
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:19,149
it's phenomenal the chocolate pieces in
there then

259
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:23,055
