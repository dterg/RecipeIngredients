00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:18,361
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode
of Laura in the Kitchen, I'm going to bring

2
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:22,212
you what I like to call my Confetti Birthday
Cake.

3
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:29,419
Now, my birthday is in November, I have never
had a birthday party in the Summer.

4
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:34,098
So, what did I do last weekend? Celebrated
my own birthday. With a birthday cake!

5
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:38,132
And I figured I'd share this recipe with you
because so many of you write me and send me

6
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:41,076
e-mails saying 'Can you show me a birthday
cake?'.

7
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:46,080
Now, you know I don't make any sort of fancy
cakes with fondant and all these cool characters,

8
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:51,035
that's just not my style - I like really good
food! And I love anything homemade.

9
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:57,514
So this is a gorgeous fluffy, light vanilla
cake with a gorgeous buttercream, so it is

10
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,570
absolutely amazing, let me take you over the
ingredients so we can get started!

11
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:07,109
You'll need all purpose flour, baking powder,
salt, granulated sugar, egg whites, unsalted

12
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:12,096
butter, softened at room temperature, a little
bit of sour cream, some whole milk, vanilla

13
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:14,100
extract and I've got some jimmies!

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,259
Now, this is what's going to go all the way
through my batter, and it's going to be so

15
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:20,297
good!

16
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:26,060
Now, comment below and let me know what your
childhood birthday cake was, now to be completely

17
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,205
honest with you, when I was a child, I didn't
want a birthday cake, I wanted pastiera. That

18
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:35,277
was the birthday cake of choice! But I would
love to know from you - And I would love to

19
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,350
know when your - your birthday month and what
the cake that you would like to have.

20
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,574
And maybe you might see it pop up on Laura
in the Kitchen!

21
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:44,976
So, I thought that might be fun!

22
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,813
I'm just taking my egg whites and I'm going
to use my standing mixer to whip these up.

23
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:56,299
I'm going to whip these until they've got
stiff peaks and I'll show you what it looks

24
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:58,059
like when they're there. It should take a
couple minutes.

25
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:58,078
Beautiful!

26
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,630
Now, I don't need the egg whites at this very
moment, I actually need them later on in the

27
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:08,075
recipe, but like I did previously on a different
episode, if I need to whip the egg whites

28
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:11,131
and do it in the standing mixer, I might as
well get them done and out of the way because

29
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:16,290
you can't whip egg whites in a dirty bowl,
so you want to get those done and out of the

30
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,290
way. So now that that's done - and don't worry
if a little bit remains, that's totally fine!

31
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:28,029
I'm going to put this back on, I'm going to
switch to a paddle attachment and I'm going

32
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:34,016
to add - get my beautiful egg whites, look
at that - out of the way.

33
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:38,097
I'm going to add my softened butter, really
important that it's nice and soft.

34
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:45,097
And my sugar. I'm going to get these nice
and creamy and fluffy. My excitement is making

35
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:52,099
me stutter, but this is going to be gorgeous,
and now you've noticed we haven't added whole

36
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,127
eggs, and that's because we want this to be
a gorgeous white fluffy cake, it's absolutely

37
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:02,120
delicious - really a treat, I have to say,
but so worth it! Especially if it's your birthday.

38
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:06,049
It's my birthday and I will eat cake all I
want! Ha!

39
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,105
It's my pretend birthday anyway!

40
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:13,014
I'm just going to whisk this up, or mix it
until it's nice and fluffy.

41
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:18,092
That's looking good, I'm going to add a splash
of vanilla extract and at this point, I'm

42
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:22,164
also going to add my sour cream. I'm not adding
very much but this little tiny bit is going

43
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:28,078
to go a long way and give you the fluffiest
thing ever - the fluffiest cake ever, but

44
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:31,120
if you don't have it, you can use yogurt,
if you don't have yogurt, just use a little

45
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,034
extra milk - it'll be totally fine.

46
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:41,052
So, raise this up, get these combined, and
in the meantime I am just going to take a

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:46,141
quick second to mix together my flour, baking
powder and salt. You don't have to do it perfectly.

48
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:52,124
Just want them to be pretty much mixed together.

49
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:59,120
Now, I"m going to add half of my flour - about
half.

50
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:01,093
And half of my milk.

51
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:07,012
Bring this back up, mix it together and then
you add the rest of your flour, the rest of

52
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:11,075
your milk and your batter is almost done!

53
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:18,075
That's looking gorgeous, I'm going to add
my jimmies in now, and the jimmies are really

54
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:25,069
the best kind of sprinkle confetti to use
for this, but by all means, you can use anything

55
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:26,121
that you prefer, this is just what I prefer.

56
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:31,280
I'm going to just take that off now.

57
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:36,476
I want to be able to fold in the egg whites
by hand, that way I can make sure that they're

58
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,237
not being over mixed and they deflate. But,
totally forgot to tell you that the first

59
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,858
thing you want to do, of course, is get your
oven preheated to 350F, get a couple of 9

60
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,460
inch baking pans, or cake pans, whatever you
call them, line them with parchment paper

61
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:53,105
and spray them well with some non-stick spray.

62
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,006
Those are ready and waiting.

63
00:04:55,015 --> 00:05:01,504
And now what I'm doing, I'm just taking my
spatula, and I like to mix everything from

64
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,641
the bottom, up.

65
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,680
Look how gorgeous that is.

66
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:08,397
And now, I'm going to take my egg whites - I'll
do half at a time - and mix that in there,

67
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:14,025
this is going to be just beautiful and it's
going to help the cake rise and it's just

68
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:14,197
stunning!

69
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,830
Just going to mix that up.

70
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:24,352
Once it's all mixed, you want to divide the
batter evenly, or as even as you can manage

71
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:31,105
among your baking pans, or your cake pans.

72
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:38,159
Okay, now these are going to go into my preheated
oven at 350F for about 30-35 minutes or until

73
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,520
they're fully cooked, and then we'll get going
on making the buttercream which if you love

74
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:48,981
wedding cake frosting, that's what a buttercream
is, it is just.. ah! The stuff of dreams.

75
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,210
Okay, let's pop this in.

76
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:56,086
My cakes baked for about 30 minutes and I've
let them cool completely on a wire rack, and

77
00:05:56,086 --> 00:06:00,145
now what I've done with one of them - they're
not too domed, because remember, we didn't

78
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,943
add the egg yolks, we just sort of whipped
the egg whites and it falls a bit, kind of

79
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:05,168
like a pavlova almost.

80
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:12,330
What I did, I put it on a cake stand and then
I just put a few pieces of parchment paper

81
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:16,232
around so that the cake stand itself doesn't
get dirty once i go ahead and frost it.

82
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,545
We're going to make a really simple buttercream
and it really couldn't be easier. The first

83
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,778
thing you're going to do is you need to start
with butter that's been softened at room temperature

84
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:31,613
- that is so, so crucial! You absolutely need
it to be at the proper stage.

85
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,937
So what I have here is a good amount of butter,
because again, this is buttercream and I'm

86
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,100
making this in my standing mixer just because
it's easier and needs to whisk for a long

87
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,214
time, so just going to pop that in.

88
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:49,210
Just going to add some vanilla extract - about
a tablespoon of it - because it is a vanilla

89
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:51,027
buttercream after all.

90
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:55,052
And I'm just going to whisk this up until
just the butter starts, you know, gets going,

91
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:59,411
and then i have some confectioner's sugar
here and some whole milk.

92
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,879
Just going to wait for this to kind of get
a head start and then we'll add in the sugar.

93
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:12,490
Okay, now what I also have here that I failed
to mention is just a small pinch of salt,

94
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:17,158
and because this is all confectioner's sugar
- which I know is a lot - but it is a buttercream,

95
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,605
you just need to add a little salt to cut
all the sweetness.

96
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,207
It really does - it's a great balance.

97
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,374
I'm just going to add my sugar, trying to
not get all over the place, and I think I

98
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,237
did pretty well.

99
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,394
Let's see.

100
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,202
Yeah.

101
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:35,650
Pretty well. And just a splash of milk, only
a couple tablespoons of milk.

102
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,240
And now I'm going to get this up and get it
going and mixing, and this could take up to

103
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:43,061
ten minutes, I mean buttercream goes from
messy, to crumbly, to perfection, so you just

104
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:43,127
need to have patience and the great thing
is you're not doing it by hand, you're using

105
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:44,065
a standing mixer, so it makes life a lot easier.

106
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:48,324
Just going to let that continue to go, go,
go until it's the perfect consistency and

107
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:55,909
I'll show you what it looks like when it's
there.

108
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,440
That is perfection!

109
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,740
It took a good four minutes of mixing, but,
I mean look at that!It's so fluffy. Look at

110
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:10,533
that!

111
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,990
So worth the wait.

112
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:17,558
So worth it. And yes, again, it's really rich
but I promise you this is a once in a while

113
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,770
treat - it's like a wedding cake, you don't
eat it very often and most of the time, frostings

114
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:24,130
that are used on wedding cakes are buttercream.

115
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:31,992
So I'm just going to mix - I get like immense
pleasure when it comes to buttercream because

116
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,690
if you make buttercream at home, then you
know the consistency that you are looking

117
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:41,098
for, so there's just something about it that
just gives me great pleasure, so this is completely

118
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,660
done, and now we'll get going on frosting.

119
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:51,066
I'm just going to take a little bit of it,
not too much, about I'd say a third.

120
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:59,034
And I'm just using an offset spatula here,
a flat spatula to just smear this, you don't

121
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:03,093
have to go all the way to the edge, although
it doesn't matter because we are going to

122
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:05,051
cover the whole thing.

123
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:08,106
Mmm, I can't wait to have a slice of this,
you have no idea!

124
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,100
If your birthday is in the Summer, jealous.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,006
Very jealous.

126
00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,047
Take the remaining frosting.

127
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:21,056
Trying to get it all out of here.

128
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:27,062
Now I have - my birthday is in November, and
I remember one year my mother threw a birthday

129
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:30,127
party for me in the Summer because I remember
crying because all my friends when I was a

130
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:35,072
child - their birthdays were in warmer months,
so they could have parties outside, and I

131
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:39,072
never could, so I remember my mother once
threw me a party in like the middle of July

132
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:43,119
which was amazing. So, I envy those who have
Summer birthdays because they get to be outside

133
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,084
and have parties.

134
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:49,120
But, I'm just going to frost this, as you
can see I'm draping down and then this is

135
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:54,067
where I love my rotating cake stand, and this
is why, by the way, you put parchment down

136
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:58,141
because if that were to happen, especially
if you are anything like me, you are a complete

137
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:04,130
and total mess when you frost cakes - it helps
a lot.

138
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:11,082
And then I just like to take the top and just
do little swirls like that.

139
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:18,055
You don't have to do this, clearly I'm not
a master at decorating cakes, it is just my

140
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:20,058
way of making it look fancy.

141
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:21,134
It's terrible, I know.

142
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:24,093
Decorating cakes is not my forte - okay?

143
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:25,145
Or my mother's.

144
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:30,081
This is why the parchment is so beautiful,
because now, you get to take the parchment

145
00:10:30,081 --> 00:10:33,120
off and you have no mess on your hands.

146
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:35,066
Don't ya love when that happens?

147
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:40,152
No mess, and then you look like a pro and
then you don't tell your friends that this

148
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:47,151
is the trick, that way they're like 'How did
you manage to do that' and you're like 'I'm

149
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:50,103
that good! I know!'.

150
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:55,052
And then I'm going to take additional jimmies,
because I want everyone to see that this is

151
00:10:55,052 --> 00:11:00,133
a confetti birthday cake. And I'm going to
put them all over the top.

152
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:04,064
The more the merrier when it comes to jimmies!

153
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:08,152
Now, somehow, there's a plate and a fork in
front of me.

154
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:13,113
Which leads me to believe that even though
it's only my pretend birthday, I should still

155
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,021
have a piece of cake.

156
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:16,114
So I'm going to do it!

157
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,106
I'm going to go in for it!

158
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:21,084
Going to go in for that right there.

159
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:25,085
Oh, that's going to be a big piece Laura!

160
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:29,097
But it is your pretend birthday, so you really
should indulge.

161
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:30,131
Waaaaa!

162
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:38,031
Now, if you don't like as much frosting, half
the recipe - make half the amount of frosting,

163
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:41,140
it'll be a really thin layer but hey, it's
your pretend birthday, you do what you want!

164
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,004
Look at that!

165
00:11:43,004 --> 00:11:46,065
Look at the jimmies all the way through.

166
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:47,056
Look!

167
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:51,143
If you had a confetti cake for your birthday,
thumbs up this video.

168
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:59,043
And I love you, and I'm jealous of you. I
really do like my pastiera.

169
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:06,087
That's where it's at!

170
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,174
Mmm hmm..

171
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:11,163
It's such a beautifully flavored cake, that
buttercream is like that wedding frosting

172
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:16,152
that we all know and love and we get to eat
like maybe once a year.

173
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,063
Absolutely divine.

174
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:21,097
