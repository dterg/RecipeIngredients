00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:18,073
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode
of Laura in the Kitchen, I want to share with

2
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:22,086
you, my recipe for what I call my jelly roll
ice cream bombe.

3
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:26,130
Now, there are so many variations you can
make, and definitely let me know if you want

4
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:30,572
to see a different variation than this one,
leave it in the comments down below.

5
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,410
But, today I want to share with you, sort
of my - it's a jelly roll, it has strawberry

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,057
jam in there and then it's going to be with
strawberry ice cream and mango sorbet.

7
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:39,636
It's phenomenal!

8
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,840
It looks incredible, it couldn't be easier.

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,171
You could definitely take a shortcut and buy
a jelly roll already pre-made, but today I

10
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:50,130
figured since I already have my ice cream
and sorbet done, we'd make the jelly roll

11
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:51,312
together!

12
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:55,760
The ingredients you will need to make the
actual jelly roll are very plain and simple

13
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:59,465
once,s you will need all purpose flour, baking
powder, salt, granulated sugar, some eggs

14
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,186
that I have separated into yolks and whites,
vanilla paste or you can use vanilla extract,

15
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,670
and some milk.

16
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:12,067
The oven is preheated to 375F, I also have
a 15 by 10 inch baking pan here that I've

17
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:14,189
lined with parchment - and you want to make
sure that you spray it with non-stick spray

18
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:18,184
as well because it can stick, even to parchment
paper.

19
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:20,088
So, precaution.

20
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:24,052
Now I'm going to make everything in my standing
mixer just because it's really easy, and the

21
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:26,114
first thing I'm going to do, is I'm actually
going to whip the egg whites.

22
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:30,042
I'm going to take my egg whites and put them
in my standing mixer, make sure your standing

23
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,103
mixer is clean.

24
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:39,003
And I'm just going to whisk these until they're
really light and frothy, and light stiff peaks,

25
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:44,157
and when they're there, I'll show you what
they look like!

26
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:46,646
They look good!

27
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,490
I don't need them to be too, too stiff.

28
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,127
I'm actually going to switch attachments,
I"m going to now take my paddle attachment

29
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:57,035
to finish the rest of the batter, but first,
I just want to get the whites out because

30
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:02,013
I don't need them until the end but I wanted
to do them first because egg whites do not

31
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:07,089
whip if your bowl is dirty, so in a case like
this, get the egg whites done first, and then

32
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,318
make the rest of your batter.

33
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,280
That way you don't have to dirty up another
bowl.

34
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:19,028
Okay, I'm adding my egg yolks and my sugar,
and now I'm going to just put on my paddle

35
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:24,724
attachment. I'm going to cream those together
until they're really light and pale and fluffy.

36
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:31,500
It'll take a couple of minutes but you're
not doing it by hand, so let it go until it's

37
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,890
nice, pale and nice and fluffy looking!

38
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:41,148
That looks excellent! I"m just going to add
in a spoonful of my vanilla paste - by all

39
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,027
means, you can use vanilla extract, but I'm
going to use vanilla paste because I really

40
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,830
want that vanilla flavor.

41
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:54,083
Blend that in, just for a quick second - doesn't
have to be perfect.

42
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,400
Lower this down.

43
00:02:56,004 --> 00:03:00,072
Mix together my flour with the baking powder
and the salt.

44
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:04,057
Going to add that in.

45
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:04,190
Whew!

46
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,010
Along with my milk.

47
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:10,790
And then we're going to pull this back up
and then just mix it until it's all combined.

48
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,888
And you do want this to be fairly, sort of
smooth, but don't over mix it otherwise it

49
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:18,783
can get a little bit tough.

50
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:26,629
That is looking gorgeous, but we do have to
fold in the egg whites, so I"m just going

51
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,470
to do that with my spatula so that I don't
deflate them too much.

52
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:36,236
But try to get all the batter off your little
beater here, or your paddle attachment.

53
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,950
As much of it as you can, anyway.

54
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:43,304
I love to always give everything a good stir
from the sides and the bottom.

55
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,720
And now I'm going to add in my egg whites.

56
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:50,981
Going to do half at a time so that I don't
deflate them and I can kind of work quickly.

57
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,674
And you can see I'm folding it, I take my
spatula, stick it right in the middle, and

58
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,260
then you fold over.

59
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:00,081
Stick in the middle, fold over.

60
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:03,087
That's such a gorgeous batter!

61
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:07,516
I love that you can see the bubbles from the
egg whites, that's just going to give you

62
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,360
really beautiful, light cake.

63
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:18,909
Okay!I'm going to do my best to flatten this
as even as I can manage with my spatula. Don't

64
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:26,128
panic if it's not perfect, because let's face
it, no one will know the difference.

65
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:31,109
And I just always like to move around the
pan because I think that just makes it easier.

66
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,047
Get it as evenly as possible.

67
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,068
Excellent!

68
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:43,094
Okay, this is going to go into your preheated
oven at 375F for twelve to fourteen minutes,

69
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:46,159
or until it's a lovely light golden color
and cooked all the way through.

70
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:49,358
Since this is pretty thin it shouldn't take
that long.

71
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:55,190
I'm going to put this in and as soon as it
comes out, I will show you the next step!

72
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:59,044
My cake is completely cooked, it cooked for
exactly fourteen minutes, and I always take

73
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:02,122
a toothpick - you can even take a dry piece
of spaghetti - stick it in the thickest part,

74
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:04,941
if there's no wet batter on it, it's good!

75
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,030
Now, let it cool for about two to three minutes,
no longer - maybe five.

76
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:14,081
Now, what I have here is a lint free kitchen
towel, about the same size as the cake, and

77
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:20,159
I'm going to cover this in some confectioner
sugar because we need to roll this up.

78
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:26,508
So you want to make sure that you sprinkle
some sugar, don't worry if it gets on your

79
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,520
counter, it's totally fine.

80
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:32,130
And now I'm going to - now I did take a knife
- a butter knife and it just releases really

81
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:40,003
easily because I did, I did grease it really,
really well. And I'm just going to invert

82
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:45,550
this, just like so, if it sticks, do not panic.

83
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,770
You see, making sure that it is really nice
- oops! - and greased, really helps, and then

84
00:05:51,077 --> 00:05:54,786
I just try to straighten it as best as I can.

85
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,550
And now I'll roll this around this way, so
you can see exactly what I'm doing, how about

86
00:05:59,055 --> 00:05:59,099
that?

87
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:05,152
Now just - you fold, literally, the towel
in the cake. Shorting.. shorting? Ha, I started

88
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:12,094
from one of the shorter ends and just roll
this tightly, but not too tight.

89
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:15,166
Just like that, and that will take the shape
of the jelly roll.

90
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:20,005
Now this has to cool completely, it could
take a couple of hours, so I'm going to place

91
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:25,599
this on a cooling rack, allow it to cool completely,
and then we'll move on to the next step.

92
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,640
Now, I did - I do have my ice cream in the
freezer already, I've got strawberry ice cream

93
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,090
and I've got my mango sorbet.

94
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,580
But I do know a great website - LauraintheKitchen.com
- who has both recipes for you if you want

95
00:06:38,058 --> 00:06:41,077
to make them from scratch, or if you want
to take a shortcut and buy them at the grocery

96
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,133
store. The choice is entirely up to you.

97
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:48,041
I'm going to let this cool completely and
then we'll move onto the next step.

98
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:54,138
Now, this was cooling for a couple of hours,
and now I'm going to unwrap it. And don't

99
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,124
worry if it looks wonky because that's - you
know, you want it to do that. Because you

100
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:01,024
want it to go back into its same shape.

101
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:06,293
And now, what I have here is some strawberry
preserves, you could use whatever preserve

102
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,600
you'd like. I mean, it's totally up to you.
And what I'm doing is I'm just spreading a

103
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,460
nice thin layer of this. I'm not going to
go all the way up, because as I roll this

104
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,061
it will squeeze out.

105
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:21,146
And as you can see there are some actual pieces
of strawberries here and there so I'm going

106
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:25,475
to try and get this as even as possible.

107
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:32,889
Kind of concentrating with leaving about an
inch or so from all sides open, because, again

108
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:39,000
when this gets rolled it does kind of squeeze
out which is totally fine, but I don't want

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,289
to overdo it.

110
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:45,300
This looks good enough, I don't want it to
be too, too thick. I'd say that looks perfect

111
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:49,009
to me, could use a spatula, but clearly a
spoon works really, really well.

112
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,077
And now, I'm going to just roll this back
up, this time you are not going to roll the

113
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,072
kitchen towel in it.

114
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:59,168
Going to roll it just like that.

115
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,797
Perfect.

116
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:08,520
And now, I'm going to put this - see it squeezes
out a little tiny bit - we didn't put too,

117
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:11,090
too much, so that should be good.

118
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:17,808
Okay, I'm going to place this here, I'm going
to just wrap this with some plastic wrap,

119
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,830
just a little bit because I don't want this
to get sort of hard, and I'm going to pop

120
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:26,171
it into the fridge for around a half hour,
or until it kind of sets and holds its shape,

121
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:32,162
and then we will get ready to start building
our bombe - ice cream bombe.

122
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:36,158
My jelly roll was in the fridge for about
an hour, now let me show you what I have here.

123
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,103
I have a large bowl, and don't worry about
the dimensions and the measurements and everything

124
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,038
because I will write everything in detail
on, you know, on the recipe and it will be

125
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:45,115
on LauraintheKitchen.com.

126
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:49,086
And I've taken a bowl and I've lined it well
with some parchment - with some plastic wrap

127
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:51,173
- and you want to make sure that the plastic
wrap is overhanging.

128
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:56,073
I have a smaller bowl, which I'll show you
what I'm going to do with it later. I have

129
00:08:56,073 --> 00:09:01,128
got some strawberry ice cream. I have left
it out at room temperature for about fifteen

130
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:05,055
minutes I would say, you want this to be a
little soft and easy for you to work with,

131
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:09,091
and then I also have an orange - some orange
juice, I just took an orange and squeezed

132
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:09,109
it.

133
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:17,009
Okay, let's get going, using a serrated knife,
I am going to cut slices of my jelly roll.

134
00:09:17,077 --> 00:09:22,135
Now, I'm not going to cut them too, too thick,
actually would it be better if I just used

135
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:24,078
this? Nah it wouldn't.

136
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:31,078
I'm going to just cut my slices, not too thick,
not too thin, about, I would say about a half

137
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:34,190
an inch thick or maybe a little bit less than
that.

138
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:39,037
Now I'm just taking slices of my jelly roll,
and if you need to tighten them up a bit,

139
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:45,066
you can, I really do not do this in any particular
order, I don't worry about things looking

140
00:09:45,066 --> 00:09:50,075
perfect, because the end result is just so
delightful that it does not matter. And you

141
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:56,094
just want to make sure that you cover the
sides and the bottom of your bowl.

142
00:09:56,094 --> 00:10:00,127
You can cut them to fit, too. Totally fine.

143
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:05,034
Just like taking a little bit of my orange
juice and just drizzling it on the cake, it

144
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:08,089
keeps it a little bit more moist and sometimes
- and I'm going to be very honest with you

145
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,096
- depending on who I'm making this for, depending
on the time of year, sometimes I do a little

146
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:16,121
grand marnier, sometimes I'm doing a cherry
base, I do a little cherry brandy. Doesn't

147
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:19,098
matter, but today, I'm using orange juice.

148
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:25,099
Okay, the ice cream should be softened enough
at this point because you do need to be able

149
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:29,019
to maneuver this around, and that is looking
good.

150
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:34,050
And if it peeks through the little holes,
then that's fine.

151
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:41,005
I just do like that, and then you kind of
push it on the sides, just like so.

152
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:50,073
Try to get it as even as you can, and I'll
show you what we're going to do with that

153
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:54,125
bowl in just a minute because the center is
going to be where we put our mango sorbet.

154
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:59,034
But not just yet, otherwise everything would
kind of blend all together.

155
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:05,051
So, I'm just going to do this as even as possible,
as quickly as possible because I don't want

156
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:07,057
the ice cream to melt too quickly.

157
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:13,100
Then I take my bowl, I make sure it's a clean
bowl, and you want to make sure that it just

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,008
fits perfect.

159
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:20,107
And I'm going to do it just like that, sorry
if I'm moving a little fast, but we're dealing

160
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,033
with ice cream.

161
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:28,107
Okay, now what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to wrap the sides like this, pop this

162
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:35,008
into the freezer for about an hour or so,
or until the strawberry ice cream is fully

163
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:40,032
frozen again and then we'll get going with
the last final layer!

164
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:44,096
Now I actually popped this into the freezer
overnight - I had a hair appointment - what

165
00:11:44,096 --> 00:11:46,160
can I say? A girl's gotta do what a girl's
gotta do! Hah!

166
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:50,093
And it's also even better because that way
you can completely forget about it and it

167
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:51,123
gets nice and frozen.

168
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:56,044
Now, a quick tip: when you have your bowl
in there, it's going to be quite frozen, so

169
00:11:56,044 --> 00:12:02,121
what I do is I take a kitchen towel, and I
sort of run it under hot water and then sit

170
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:09,021
my kitchen towel in the bowl for a couple
minutes until it kind of starts to thaw the

171
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,029
ice cream right around the bowl just a little
bit and then it comes out super easy and simple.

172
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:17,026
Now, what I have here is some mango sorbet,
and it's at room temperature - well not at

173
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:20,098
room temperature, I left it out at room temperature
for a bit because I want this to be really

174
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:22,123
nice and smooth and pliable.

175
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:27,104
Now that I removed the bowl, I'm going to
fill this with my mango sorbet.

176
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:33,004
That looks really lovely, I'm going to save
that for myself.

177
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:38,057
I'm going to cover this back up with my plastic
wrap because you want to make sure it's nice

178
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:38,152
and covered.

179
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:46,052
I'm actually going to take this little plate
and just sort of squeeze everything together.

180
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:52,118
Now, I'm going to pop this back into the freezer
for several hours, it needs to - the mango

181
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:57,018
sorbet needs to be completely frozen, it could
take up to a couple of hours, and then it

182
00:12:57,018 --> 00:13:01,044
will be time to unveil this beauty.

183
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:07,068
So once everything is frozen, and solid, it's
good to go - now what I've done, I've just

184
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:11,122
taken a small paring knife and just gone around
the edges, and just kind of sliced them so

185
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:17,119
it's just almost one flat layer that way it
holds better - it doesn't wobble as much when

186
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,104
you try to cut it - but don't throw them away.
Cooks treat, you always have to have one of

187
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:24,102
those, it's the best part of the job. Now
you're ready to serve it!

188
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:25,065
It's very simple.

189
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:30,138
Now what I have here is my platter, this is
just a cake stand, a round cake stand.

190
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,127
I'm going to flip this around.

191
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:39,116
Now, we have plastic wrap, so that really
helps make the job a lot easier.

192
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:45,101
I'm just going to take my chef's knife and
I'm kind of dunking it into warm water, now

193
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,086
I'm drying it off on a clean kitchen towel.

194
00:13:48,086 --> 00:13:52,086
And it'll go in really easy.

195
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:56,112
And that makes for a really nice, clean - now
this is a really big slice, because mainly

196
00:13:57,012 --> 00:14:03,012
I want to show you what - how beautiful this
is on the outside. I mean the outside is just

197
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:07,016
gorgeous, and the inside is going to be even
prettier, so I take that.

198
00:14:07,016 --> 00:14:09,041
Look at that!

199
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,129
Is that not beautiful?!

200
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:17,053
Now, what you can do, you can also make this
multiple layer. So instead of doing two layers

201
00:14:17,053 --> 00:14:20,145
of ice cream like I did, you could do cherry
ice cream, chocolate, and just do a bunch

202
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,069
of different layers, that would be really
fun.

203
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:27,116
But I like this combination because I think
the jelly roll with the strawberry jam and

204
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:31,105
then the strawberry ice cream, which is so
creamy and delicious, with the mango sorbet,

205
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,081
I think it's absolute magic.

206
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,135
I'm going to give this a try.

207
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:35,094
That looks beautiful

208
00:14:35,094 --> 00:14:39,167
Let's give this a go, I'm going to have to
hold on just a little bit because it's a really

209
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,160
big piece.

210
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:46,060
Yeah, I want that right there. I want a little
bit of everything.

211
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:54,014
I was going to do this, because I'm so used
to it!

212
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:54,122
Mmm.

213
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:57,058
Very cold though.

214
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:58,120
That is awesome.

215
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:03,003
It's got like everything you could possibly
want.

216
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:05,005
Really cold though!

217
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,046
Ohh!

218
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:10,114
That's really cold!

219
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:17,061
It has everything you could possibly want,
a beautiful sweet sponge cake, a little sweetness

220
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,117
from the jam, the combination of the strawberry
and the mango is like a match made in food

221
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,026
heaven. And it really couldn't be easier.

222
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:27,080
You can make this way ahead of time if you
do have a dinner party you want to make this

223
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,023
for.

224
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:28,139
Perfect for Summer.

225
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,094
