00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:20,098
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and today, upon
your requests, we are making Cookie Dough

2
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:20,184
Ice Cream!

3
00:00:21,084 --> 00:00:26,172
I've had so many people ask for this recipe,
it's insane! And, it's actually really really

4
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:32,072
simple. I've also had some people ask me if
cookie dough ice cream is just simply crushed

5
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:36,114
up chocolate chip cookies in ice cream. It's
not, so today we are going to make the real

6
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,030
thing.

7
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:42,582
It's so, so easy, and ice cream is something
that I really only make in the Summertime,

8
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,790
so I'm always looking forward to sharing a
new recipe with you.

9
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,168
The recipe to make the custard is pretty simple
and basic. You're going to need some whole

10
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:55,153
milk, heavy cream, egg yolks, sugar, I also
have a pinch of salt and either vanilla bean,

11
00:00:56,053 --> 00:01:01,072
or I've got some vanilla bean paste here so
it makes my life a little bit easier.

12
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,010
This is really easy. Now, we are going to
make the custard now, and then I'll show you

13
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:08,015
later how to make the cookie dough and then
when we combine everything together it is

14
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:09,554
going to be money!

15
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,650
Okay, let's get started - so simple!

16
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:17,464
I've got a large sauce pan here, and in here
I'm going to add my cream and milk, add them

17
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:21,000
both at the same time - makes me feel fancy
like that.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,979
And then we're going to add in a good spoonful
of the vanilla paste. You would need one vanilla

19
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,560
bean that you would scrape down and get rid
of - you know, take all the seeds out and

20
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:39,056
put it in here - the vanilla beans. But, I'm
using vanilla paste so, a nice healthy spoonful

21
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,640
of that should do the trick.

22
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,390
So, I'm just going to take this off.

23
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:49,648
I'm going to put this on my stove top, and
let this come to temperature to a simmer over

24
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:51,640
about medium-low heat.

25
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:56,213
Now, while my milk mixture is coming to a
simmer, I'm going to just take my egg yolks

26
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:02,060
and sugar with a little pinch of salt, and
I"m going to whisk these together until the

27
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:06,088
mixture becomes really nice, thick and pale
in color. I'll show you what it looks like

28
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:11,144
when it gets there. Basically - essentially
what we are making right now is kind of like

29
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:17,053
a zabaglione, zabaglione is nothing but - which
I'll show you in a different recipe - is just

30
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,112
egg yolks, sugar, a little bit of booze, and
you are good to go!

31
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:26,021
But this needs to be whisked until it's really
light and pale, and about doubled in volume.

32
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:31,013
I'll show you what it looks like when it's
there. Keep an eye out on your milk mixture,

33
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:35,051
you do not want it to come to a boil, because
if it does, it will split and then you're

34
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:39,100
going to have to start all over and waste
all that milk and cream and vanilla. So, keep

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,008
an eye on that it should take just a coupe
of minutes and you should be done with the

36
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:49,095
egg yolk mixture as well - and you're getting
an awesome arm workout while you're at it!

37
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:52,181
My milk is at the right temperature, you can
see there are little bubbles starting to form

38
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:57,134
around the edge of the pot, which is when
I know that it's at a perfect simmer.

39
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:02,117
My egg yolk, as you can see, i'll show you
the texture - the consistency - see it kind

40
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,044
of falls down on a ribbon, oh that's perfect!

41
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:10,093
I'm going to temper the egg yolks by just
taking a little bit of my milk mixture, just

42
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:14,101
about a half cup or so, and this is all it's
doing is tempering the egg yolks so that they

43
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:20,157
don't get shocked when you pour them into
the pan with the hot liquid.

44
00:03:21,057 --> 00:03:22,074
That's all you need to do.

45
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:29,074
I'm going to now pour my egg yolk mixture
into my pan, very simple, just making an easy,

46
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:36,095
easy and very classic ice cream custard base.

47
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:40,160
Now I'm going to - look at the color of that!
Look at that color!It just makes me so happy,

48
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:42,019
you have no idea!

49
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:47,125
Okay, I am going to just switch back to my
wooden spoon, and I'm going to cook this over

50
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:53,029
about low heat until it thickens really nicely
and it coats the back of my spoon, and I will

51
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:58,090
show you what it looks like when it's there.
Just make sure you keep this at a low heat

52
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:03,078
and take your time and be gentle, because
if this comes to a boil, or it gets too hot,

53
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:08,120
it will split. And once it splits, again,
you will know when it splits, and there is

54
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:12,030
no going back, so just take your time.

55
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:17,143
Stir it in a figure eight motion, kind of
like I am doing right now.

56
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:22,084
And then just be patient and when it gets
nice and thick, you will be able to notice

57
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,168
it immediately.

58
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:29,102
My custard is ready, it has been cooking for
about six minutes and you can see it is coating

59
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:34,231
the back of a spoon and if I run my finger
down and the custard stays separated, you

60
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:35,256
know it's thick enough!

61
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:39,930
Doesn't really get any easier than that! I'm
going to pass this through a sieve just in

62
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:44,102
case there are any egg shells remaining or
anything curdled, or whatever. It stays back,

63
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:47,900
and doesn't get into your final mixture.

64
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,678
As you can see, this is smooth sailing all
the way.

65
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,280
That's how I like it! That's how I like it!

66
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,081
Nice and smooth, there's really nothing - maybe
a little, little tiny bit of something remaining,

67
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,660
but for the most part everything is really
nice and smooth.

68
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,410
Okay, now, you need to wrap this with plastic
wrap, and you want to make sure that the plastic

69
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:12,560
is actually touching the surface of the custard,
because otherwise it just forms a really weird

70
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:17,505
looking skin that you don't want and it's
definitely not going to be smooth and delightful

71
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,052
once you go ahead and freeze this.

72
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,610
So I'm going to pop this into the fridge - it
needs to be in the fridge for about four to

73
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:27,112
six hours or best, overnight. That's even
better. If you can put this in the fridge

74
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:33,030
overnight, it's even better. I'm going to
leave this in, it's pretty early in the day

75
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:36,402
so I'll get to finish this this afternoon
and I'll show you what it looks like once

76
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:37,580
this is chilled.

77
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:42,857
We'll get going on making our cookie dough
and we'll pull the whole thing off together!

78
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,490
While the custard is chilling, we're going
to get going on making the cookie dough batter.

79
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:50,090
Now we're actually making a chocolate chip
cookie dough batter here, and now, if that

80
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,488
- chocolate chip cookie dough - if that bothers
you because none of this is going to be cooked,

81
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,420
so you're kind of eating raw cookie dough,
which I love and I know everyone eats raw

82
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:04,120
cookie dough at some point in their lives
- now if this bothers you, then you might

83
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:08,030
want to skip this ice cream in its entirety.
You can make my chocolate ice cream, you can

84
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:12,112
make my strawberry, mint chocolate chip, vanilla
whatever you want - I've got a ton of recipes

85
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:13,180
on my website.

86
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:18,021
But, most of the time, cookie dough ice cream
has actual cookie dough in it, and that's

87
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:18,099
what makes it so delicious.

88
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,100
So, we're going to make it like we would make
chocolate chip cookies, but really easy - and

89
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,061
to do that, you'll need some all purpose flour,
I've got a pinch of salt and I've got some

90
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:32,830
instant espresso powder here, just a small
little pinch, brown sugar, granulated sugar,

91
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:38,770
some softened unsalted butter, an egg, vanilla
extract, and what I have here are some chocolate

92
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:41,696
chips that I've pulsed in my food processor
so you can see that I've got little rubbles,

93
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:46,620
I've got some that are bigger. I've got some
that are kind of whole, and I think the thing

94
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:50,571
that I love about cookie dough ice cream is
that you actually get bits and pieces of chocolate

95
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:53,170
chips or chocolate throughout the entire ice
cream.

96
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,624
And I think that just by pulsing it a few
times, and breaking the pieces up a bit just

97
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:02,580
gives it a little more interest, and I think
these itty bitty, almost dust-like pieces

98
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:05,867
of the chocolate is what makes this so divine,
in my opinion.

99
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,484
So if you want to skip doing that part, by
all means, do that, but I think that it's

100
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,080
kind of crucial.

101
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:15,557
I also have a nine by thirteen inch baking
pan here, and I have a big piece of parchment

102
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:18,645
paper because you want to make sure you can
lift it up.

103
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,795
That's sitting aside, so let's get going,
I'm going to just cream together my butter,

104
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:23,893
and both kinds of sugar.

105
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,385
I'm going to do this in just a little bowl
because I don't feel like getting my mixer

106
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:34,284
out for just a small batch, so I'm just going
to mix these two together until combined.

107
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:40,240
That's looking good enough, I'm going to add
in my egg. Again, you want to make sure that

108
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:45,483
whoever you're making this for will eat raw
cookie dough. Just want to make sure you don't

109
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,795
have anyone that can't eat raw egg or whatnot,
just give them a heads up.

110
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:56,659
I'm going to switch to my whisk briefly, just
to mix everything together a little bit better.

111
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,610
Just mixing together the coffee and salt.
Now I'm not adding any leavening agents to

112
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,960
this - no baking soda - you don't need to,
I mean you're not baking it so it's not going

113
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:06,518
to make a difference.

114
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,471
I'm going to put my egg mixture in here, normally
I would put the dry into my wet, but I switched

115
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:17,107
bowls for some reason and the flour was in
the bigger bowl and I just wanted to have

116
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:20,848
plenty of room to mix this together.

117
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,273
And that's basically all I'm doing, I'm just
going to combine this until it forms into

118
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,943
a dough, and then I can add in - I can actually
add in my chocolate now because it's almost

119
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,430
there so I might as well because I don't want
to overwork this anyway.

120
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:42,075
Add in my chocolate chip mixture, you can
also add - take a bar of chocolate and chop

121
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:46,160
that up if you wanted to, that would be lovely,
instead of adding chocolate chips, or you

122
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,081
can add mini chocolate chips.

123
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:54,049
But, you see what I mean when I say that I
think that this is so much better because

124
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:59,958
that way you're really getting chocolate throughout
every little teeny tiny bite of the cookie

125
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:00,430
dough.

126
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,380
Otherwise, you just get chocolate chips here,
chocolate chips there, but I want chocolate

127
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:08,057
completely infused throughout the entire cookie
dough, so that's why I like to pulse it, and

128
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,443
it's those kinds of little things that really
make a difference, otherwise you know I would

129
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,310
skip it.

130
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:19,031
Okay, now I'm going to put this closer to
me, get my cookie dough out of here.

131
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,870
Oops!

132
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,110
We'll fix that in a minute, do not panic!

133
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:26,002
Talking to myself, by the way.

134
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:31,017
Now, all I'm doing - and this can be a little
bit tricky, I'm trying to get this into a

135
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:36,017
pretty thin layer because when we freeze this
and I pull this out of the freezer, we're

136
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:41,104
going to need to chop it into small pieces.
But clearly, you can see that I'm not too

137
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:45,723
worried about getting it perfect, and I don't
want you to be that worried about it either.

138
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,772
And it doesn't have to be all on one layer,
I'm just doing it this way because it's easier

139
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,300
to cut it once it's frozen.

140
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:58,066
So, just going to do that, and then I'm going
to pop this into my freezer, probably for

141
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:01,138
several hours or however long it takes for
the custard to chill.

142
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:05,487
The more frozen, the better. The easier it's
going to be for us to chop it up.

143
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:10,250
So I'm going to pop this in, looks odd now,
but trust me when I tell you, it works wonders.

144
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:15,304
Popping this in, waiting for my custard to
get nice and cool, and then we'll go on and

145
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:20,910
put it all in the little machine and get that
much closer to eating cookie dough ice cream!

146
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:25,104
My custard was in the fridge overnight, I
was going to leave it in there for a few hours,

147
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:30,016
but then we had my aunt over, and maybe a
cocktail or two, and we decided to wait until

148
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:33,091
tomorrow to have ice cream - which is good
because it's the weekend - perfect time for

149
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,690
entertaining and having ice cream!

150
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:40,480
Now, I have my ice cream machine here, you
want to make sure that the insert of your

151
00:10:40,048 --> 00:10:43,137
ice cream machine, which is this right here,
that's going to basically freeze your ice

152
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:46,316
cream for you, is frozen.

153
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:51,040
Now, you want to always check your manufacturer's
instructions because every ice cream machine

154
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:55,033
is different from others, so mine says to
put it in there overnight, so that's what

155
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,130
I do, and it's really nice and frozen solid
which is really important, so make sure that

156
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:03,032
you read your instructions because some might
just need a couple of hours, but most of the

157
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,120
time they'll take overnight.

158
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:12,012
Now I have my really cold custard, which is
absolutely fantastic, I mean look at that!

159
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:18,130
This would be good on it's own, as-is over
top of maybe berries or whatnot.

160
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:21,064
I'm going to pour that in there.

161
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:24,130
Get it all out.

162
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:29,957
Okay, and now I'm just going to turn this
on, now again, check your manufacturer's instructions

163
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,750
because the time is going to vary.

164
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:36,117
Mine takes a good twenty-five to thirty minutes
to freeze the ice cream, but they're all so

165
00:11:37,017 --> 00:11:37,019
different.

166
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:41,616
So, I'm going to wait for this to be pretty
much - pretty much fully frozen, and then

167
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:44,880
we'll get going on adding our cookie dough!

168
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:49,129
Alright, my ice cream is exactly where I want
it.

169
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:53,093
It's been about twenty five minutes, now I'm
going to take my cookie dough that was in

170
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,125
the freezer overnight as well, which is what
we want.

171
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:59,113
And this is why I do it on parchment because
it's so easy!

172
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:07,013
And now, I just take a sharp knife, and in
no particular way, I just - I'm just going

173
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,800
to chop this up into bite sized pieces, that
is it.

174
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:16,075
You can - you really can do this a couple
of different ways. Instead of doing it the

175
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:22,526
way I am doing it, you can take little teaspoons
of the batter - you know, once you make it

176
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:27,180
and then put it on a baking sheet lined with
parchment and freeze it that way and then

177
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:30,597
you can just put them right into your ice
cream machine.

178
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:36,300
I tend to do it this way, I don't know why,
I just think it's easier, and gets the job

179
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:42,071
done a lot faster, and you can also leave
certain pieces bigger or smaller, like that's

180
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:43,175
perfect.

181
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:51,075
Now I'm just going to go across, and just
rough chop-age on everything until you've

182
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,690
got about bite sized pieces.

183
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:54,648
That's it!

184
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,277
And I did want to mention that it sounds like
this is really hard, but it's not, it just

185
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:04,220
sounds hard because we're cutting through
chocolate.

186
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:08,371
I just wanted to mention that because as I
was doing this, I'm thinking - you know you

187
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,190
can hear the crunch, but the crunch is just
because we are chopping up the chocolate,

188
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,020
so anyway, figured I would let you guys know
that.

189
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,118
And now I'm just going to take these - and
you can cut these as big or as small as you

190
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,061
want.

191
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:26,136
And you can add as much or as little as you
want to your cookie dough batter, it's up

192
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:27,094
to you.

193
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:32,173
I'm going to add most of it, but most likely
not all of it because it's a lot, and then

194
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,112
we can also add some for people to serve,
you know, sprinkle on top.

195
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:44,949
Then just let them mix in as this is running.

196
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,081
Yeah buddy!

197
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:53,230
Now I only added about half of the chocolate
cookie dough mixture in here because I didn't

198
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,041
want to add too, too much because then you
can also have a hard time with your machine

199
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,000
being able to handle all that.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But look at this!

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,829
I mean, are you seeing what I'm seeing?!

202
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:12,100
And also, are you seeing how those little
rubbles of chocolate kind of spread all throughout

203
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:17,003
the batter?And that's from when I took the
chocolate chips and put them through the food

204
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,008
processor, because that's what I personally
like.

205
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:23,597
Obviously, you want big chocolate chips here
and there, but why have a little bit when

206
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:26,000
you can have chocolate throughout?

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,025
Ah, look at that, if you get up close you
can see that it's really creamy, it has those

208
00:14:32,025 --> 00:14:34,674
big chunks of cookie dough.

209
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:37,948
I'm just going to make myself a little ice
cream. Okay?

210
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:39,040
Just a scoop.

211
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:43,086
Just a scoop, on a cone because I'm deserving.

212
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:43,111
Look!

213
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:44,036
Whoooaa!

214
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:44,111
Look at that!

215
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:50,480
Look at all the pieces!

216
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,654
Mmm.

217
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,332
You'll love this!

218
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,630
I promise you will love this.

219
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,644
It's so easy, tastes so much better than store
bought, I cannot stress it enough.

220
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,208
It's insanely easy to do, doesn't take a lot
of time, it doesn't take any fancy ingredients.

221
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,832
It's very basic but it's done the right way,
and you can see - I mean, it's just - it's

222
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:16,154
phenomenal.

223
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,430
Look at the chocolate pieces in there!

224
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:18,872
[humming]

225
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:25,360
I was trying to sing in my head, but...

226
00:15:25,036 --> 00:15:29,075
LauraintheKitchen.com will have the recipe
written for you, let me know what ice cream

227
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,850
you want to see next.

228
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:30,180
Hope you've enjoyed spending time with me
and I'll see you next time!

229
00:15:31,009 --> 00:16:32,013
Bye bye!
