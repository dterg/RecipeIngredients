1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,173
many Italian island today on highly
cooking or making McDonald

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,442
knock-off full efficient watch this is
alway better than McDonalds range and

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,010
and I'm gonna tell you if the most are
the hot guy and then it and here's a

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:11,032
hint

5
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:15,038
have to do to Jesus pass

6
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:20,083
well home

7
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,124
that

8
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:26,057
way to start out

9
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:29,120
dour anything fish anything to Lafayette
try to get like as

10
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:33,080
big ever fully as you can anything said
sorta firm

11
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:36,152
will do well I caliber a cod and

12
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:40,104
we're just gonna try to cut it into
square ash shape so that it looks a

13
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:41,075
little bit like

14
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,111
down the nets and half way back saffir
this

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:49,072
little interesting shaped thing here
sorry kind of

16
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:52,087
starting to split their summers gonna go
ahead and cut it

17
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:55,486
diamono and then

18
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,350
trim of like the little pointy

19
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:05,594
and bet just cannot trust squared off a
lover

20
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,470
and you can still awake you know cook
these in in them

21
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:12,078
when I like fissionable or something but
and

22
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:16,113
they want gonna say much because they're
not perfect so then these lines are cut

23
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:19,078
in half these ones coming on

24
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:22,135
mommy so ashamed to have my language
there right now I'm

25
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:27,057
bad grammar so they're not exactly
square but they're

26
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:31,149
rectangular and thats a type a square
guys than others but the memorable here

27
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:36,918
all the little pieces same

28
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,960
army to tiny and then squeeze San
oranges

29
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,185
over awesome said skin like brighten up
the flavor a little bit we're just not

30
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:46,171
this marinated in lemon juice

31
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:50,480
for about 10 minutes in that time we can
make our

32
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,165
McDonald's Corp of tartar sauce to make
sure our little fishies get covered

33
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:58,600
you don't have one man you could use are
a little bit like white wine vinegar

34
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:00,525
something arson tarragon vinegar

35
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,132
would make it a fancy French

36
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,300
filet of fish Philip French not be
something else entirely okay I'm and get

37
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,048
set up

38
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:12,122
and will make aren't her shots while we
wait on us man

39
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:17,030
obviously tires are starts with a man is
based now if you would like

40
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,041
a more fancy time to turn it off I have
a recipe for

41
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:23,097
one with parsley and capers and Carl
Icahn

42
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,280
others other shit on a website if you
want to do that but this

43
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:30,069
is what I think is closest to

44
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,124
the McDonalds tartar sauce which really
just can t spectacles said is at a

45
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:35,045
little pinch of salt

46
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:38,111
man and a woman in white paper this is
my own fancy attach

47
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:42,057
sure it's not the real thing but it has
trended and then

48
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:45,114
to make it McDonald the this is just
some

49
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:50,021
diced up like hamburger dole fleiss's
just mentioned really tiny

50
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:53,042
in a adding a little bit of that pickle
juice in there champ

51
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:56,043
so down plaid and

52
00:02:56,052 --> 00:03:00,077
down there and then some super

53
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:06,090
min step why and as well just like the
10-year

54
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:10,072
you can chop it better I'm a magician
with a knife

55
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:14,076
you could use a food processor if you
have bad skills

56
00:03:14,076 --> 00:03:20,162
and with nixon something

57
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:25,099
that argument to the devil oh that
reminds me so the story

58
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,108
have the flatfish as the sky in Ohio
that had

59
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,070
franchise when McDonald's for stars
franchising he was making any money

60
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:32,098
during Lent

61
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:36,095
because his a really eighty-nine percent
catholic or something so he like all

62
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:36,141
that

63
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:40,052
wanna mcdonnell himself and he was like
looked on

64
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:44,116
sorry I mean rhyme I'm not making any
money over here in Ohio and make a fish

65
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,072
sandwich data for an abrupt

66
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:49,107
route I was like I don't think so buddy
then

67
00:03:50,007 --> 00:03:53,050
he tasted it and he was like wow this is
the best

68
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,027
sandwich ever not better than my
hamburgers but you have my permission to

69
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:56,160
put it on your menu

70
00:03:57,006 --> 00:04:00,051
and centers restaurant and then it went
nationwide like the next year

71
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:04,089
cell there you go time to read the
donuts

72
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:07,166
I mean the fish I mean don't okay so I
drained

73
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:11,070
the lemon juice of I've the fish fillets
and down

74
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:18,037
and some now because no alcohol
something and as your body good

75
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:22,062
just enough to cover too many wasted how
drink that later

76
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:28,100
my passion so just get them all

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,047
in a rather hang out time

78
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:36,084
and then for the breading part what I
dan is a mashed up some moisture

79
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,090
crackers here

80
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,338
until they're very very fine these ROIs
to crackers

81
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,323
they taste like saltines but they look
like or stirs I don't know either

82
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,240
con that but that's a good enough reason
I think I like to use these one

83
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,963
i'm reading stuff instead of saltines
because one there cheaper than saltines

84
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:54,773
by like

85
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,020
a few sense but I am NOT free will
beeotch and also they're already in tiny

86
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:03,051
pieces so they break up faster so I did
was

87
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,075
puts on them into this little

88
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,690
the tough baggy and Krishna

89
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,933
until they're fairly fine most of them

90
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,453
are powder ash and a min ago

91
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,762
but add a little bit of plain dry bread
crumbs to that to you

92
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,810
if you want to just use breadcrumbs
that's fine

93
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:28,870
but I felt like the crackers kinda gives
it and better

94
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,740
coming cell just like that together

95
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:36,087
and thus the crackers are you have salt
on into the night nanny salts and esters

96
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:39,091
it's enough not salt with just what's on
the crackers

97
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:44,516
10 hours new standard milk crackers not
crackers

98
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,850
plate the

99
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,760
there

100
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:57,122
okay ac if fishing areas and I want
their coated you want them in the fridge

101
00:05:58,022 --> 00:05:59,061
for at least 10 minutes

102
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,062
up to two or three hour she can make you
had had a little bit

103
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:05,110
and that's going to help that cutting it
here said on Friday doesn't just like

104
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,047
fall off into that

105
00:06:07,056 --> 00:06:10,089
trying well Easter so I'll see that
tenants

106
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:14,096
to fry the fish and got just under about
a half inch

107
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:17,158
peanut oil here you can use canola oil
and destroy whatever

108
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:21,136
enough stuff like that and got heated up
to about 350

109
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:25,124
if you don't have a thermometer you can
just throw in a little read crime like

110
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:26,060
this

111
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:30,102
just across and saw lights not not
peeing that sizzling sound

112
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:35,151
and will are fleas and and you remember
when I

113
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:39,116
I'm cut them out I ended up with two
that were a little bit thicker

114
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,025
and tuner little bit then are so the
thicker ones honest they're gonna take a

115
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,043
little bit longer Kirk

116
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:49,102
cell math come easier sometimes just to
do them

117
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:53,070
together to thank you once again there
and then if anyone's that basically we

118
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,033
just got cookies for

119
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,181
I met on the far side and Phil be nice
golden brown

120
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:01,116
what mother doing under two minutes or
so on a second time

121
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:05,042
until that's going around by then inside
should be

122
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:08,139
perfectly cooked and you to fall off and
flaky and mores

123
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,112
like a fish sandwich

124
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:18,019
here we go

125
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:25,019
cell

126
00:07:25,058 --> 00:07:28,155
just check out the second plane usually
brown slower than the first sessy

127
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:33,055
still prepay of felt like them but maybe
another minute or so

128
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:37,064
if you wanted to make the lower-fat you
can also totally

129
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:40,069
thank them just to the breading ass

130
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,072
spray it with a little better you know
spray or something

131
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:47,125
and bake it on it like a tray with iraq
like this by many as the spring training

132
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:51,046
but you can just take it on here at 4:15

133
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:54,069
for about 15 minutes it's not going to
get like

134
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,163
as selectively golden brown ft youth but
it will be christie and

135
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:01,075
curt and I'll be much healthier then
