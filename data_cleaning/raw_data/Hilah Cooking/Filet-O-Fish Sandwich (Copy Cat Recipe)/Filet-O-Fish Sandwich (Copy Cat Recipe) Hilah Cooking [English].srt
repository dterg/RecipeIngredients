00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:04,062
Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking,
we're making McDonald's knock off filet-o-fish

2
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:08,138
sandwich. This is way better than the McDonald's
version and I'm going to tell you a fun little

3
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:16,038
story about how it got invented. And here's
a hint. It has to do with Jesus.

4
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:28,003
Okay to start out, duh, we're going to use
some fish. I'm using tilapia. Try to get like

5
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:36,089
as big of a fillet as you can, anything sort
of firm will do well, like halibut or cod.

6
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:40,861
And we're just going to try to cut it into
squarish shapes so that it looks a little

7
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,337
bit like McDonald's even though it's going
to taste way better. So for this little interesting

8
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,210
shaped thing here, it's already kind of starting
to split there. So I'm just going to go ahead

9
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:59,021
and cut it down the middle and then trim off
like the little pointy end bits. Just to kind

10
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,496
of try to kind of square it off a little bit
and you can still like cook these and eat

11
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:14,450
them like little fish nibbles or something,
but they won't go on our sandwich because

12
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:19,924
they're not perfect. So then these ones I'll
cut in half, these ones, oh my god, my mom

13
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:26,700
would be so ashamed of my language, sorry
mom, bad grammar. So there, they're not exactly

14
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,043
square, but they're rectangular and that's
a type of squares guys.

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:36,021
So then I'm going to just put them in a little
bowl here, all the little pieces. Some of

16
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:43,021
them are maybe too tiny and then squeeze some
lemon juice over. Awesome. So that's just

17
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,898
going to like brighten up the flavor a little
bit, we're just going to let this marinate

18
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:51,836
in the lemon juice for about ten minutes.
In that time we can make our McDonald's rip-off

19
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,170
tartar sauce. I just want to make sure all
the little fishies get covered. If you don't

20
00:01:56,017 --> 00:02:00,038
have lemon, you could use a little bit of
like white wine vinegar something, or tarragon

21
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:07,038
vinegar would make it a fancy French filet-o-fish,
filet-o-French and that would be something

22
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:11,021
else entirely. Okay, I'm going to get set
up and we'll make our tartar sauce while we

23
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,101
wait on this marinade.

24
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:18,079
Obviously tartar sauce starts with a mayonnaise
base. Now if you would like a more fancy type

25
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:23,808
of tartar sauce, I have a recipe for one with
parsley and capers and garlic and all this

26
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,080
other shit, on our website if you want to
do that, but this is what I think is closest

27
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:34,019
to the McDonald's tartar sauce which really
just kind of tastes like pickles. So I just

28
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,042
add a little pinch of salt, I'm going to add
a little bit of white pepper. This is my unfancy

29
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:42,108
touch. I'm sure it's not in the real thing,
but it tastes really good. And then to make

30
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:49,009
it look McDonaldsy, this is just some diced
up like hamburger dill slices, just mince

31
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:53,937
them up really tiny and then add in a little
bit of that pickle juice in there too. So

32
00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:01,099
dump that in. Just dump it all in there. And
then some super minced up white onion as well.

33
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:11,629
And just like the tinier you can chop it the
better. I'm a magician with a knife. You could

34
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:15,070
use a food processor if you have bad skills.

35
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:22,007
And we'll just mix it up. There's salt on
my finger, better give it to the devil. Oh,

36
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:29,061
that reminds me. So the story of the filet-o-fish:
there was this guy in Ohio that had a franchise

37
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:33,062
when McDonald's first started franchising
and he wasn't making any money during Lent

38
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:37,137
because his area was like 89 percent Catholic
or something. So he like called Ronald McDonalds

39
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:43,656
himself and he was like, look Don, sorry I
mean Ron I'm not making any money over here

40
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,760
in Ohio, I need to make a fish sandwich stat
before I go broke. And Ronald McDonalds was

41
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:53,005
like, I don't think so buddy. Then he tasted
it and he was like, wow, this is the best

42
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,230
sandwich ever, not better than my hamburgers,
but you have my permission to put it on your

43
00:03:57,023 --> 00:04:01,642
menu and that saved his restaurant and then
it went nationwide like the next year. So,

44
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,866
there you go.

45
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:08,610
It's time to bread the doughnuts, I mean the
fish, I mean the doughnuts. Okay, so I drained

46
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:15,061
the lemon juice off of the fish fillets and
now I'm going to add some milk because milk

47
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,290
is a wholesome thing and it does your body
good; just enough to cover. Don't need to

48
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:27,029
waste it, I'll drink that later. Some white
Russians, okay. So just get them all in there,

49
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,102
they're hanging out, that's fine.

50
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:37,047
And then for the breading part, what I've
done is I've mashed up some oyster crackers

51
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:44,047
here until they're very, very fine. These
are oyster crackers. They taste like saltines,

52
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:47,104
but they look like oysters, I don't really
know why they're called that, but that's a

53
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:52,059
good enough reason I think. I like to use
these when I'm breading stuff instead of saltines

54
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:58,072
because one, they're cheaper than saltines
by like a few cents, but I'm a frugal b-otch

55
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:02,169
and also they're already in tiny pieces so
they break up faster. So all I did was put

56
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:10,069
some of them into this little zip top baggy
and crushed them up until they're fairly fine.

57
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:19,052
Most of them are powderish and I'm going to
go ahead and add a little bit of plain dry

58
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:25,113
bread crumbs to that too. If you wanted to
just use bread crumbs, that's fine, but I

59
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:32,078
felt like the crackers kind of gives it a
better coating. So just mix that together

60
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:36,103
and the crackers already have salt on them,
so we don't need to add any salt to this,

61
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,099
it's enough salt with just what's on the crackers.

62
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:46,099
And now we're just going to do the standard
milk, crackers, milk, crackers, plate. Okay,

63
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:57,081
alright, fish fingers. Okay, once they're
coated you want to put them in the fridge

64
00:05:58,003 --> 00:06:01,094
for at least ten minutes up to two or three
hours, so you can make these ahead of time

65
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:05,026
a little bit. That's going to help that coating
adhere so that when we fry it, it doesn't

66
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:10,090
just like fall off into the frying oil either.
So I'll see you back in ten minutes.

67
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,032
To fry the fish, I've got just under about
a half inch of peanut oil here, you can use

68
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:20,066
canola oil, vegetable oil, whatever, you know,
stuff like that. And I've got it heated up

69
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:25,108
to about 350. If you don't have a thermometer,
you can just throw in a little bread crumb

70
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:32,041
like this, just a crumb and it's all like,
not it's not peeing, that's a sizzling sound.

71
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,069
And we'll put our filets in.

72
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:39,135
And you remember when I cut them up, I ended
up with two that were a little bit thicker

73
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:42,118
and two that were a little bit thinner. So
the thicker ones obviously are going to take

74
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:49,071
little bit longer to cook, so I don't know.
It's kind of easier sometimes just to do them

75
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:53,071
together, do the thicker ones together and
then the thinner ones, but basically we're

76
00:06:53,071 --> 00:06:57,128
just going to cook these for about a minute
on the first side, they'll be nice and golden

77
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:02,125
brown. Flip them over, do another two minutes
or so on the other side until that's golden

78
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:10,025
brown and by then, the inside should be perfectly
cooked and beautiful and flaky and moist like

79
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:14,087
a fish sandwich.

80
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:21,087
There we go. So just check it. The second
side usually browns slower than the first

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,046
so see, it's still pretty pale, so let it
go maybe another minute or so. If you wanted

82
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:40,109
to make these lower fat, you can also totally
bake them. Just do the breading, spray it

83
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:45,075
with a little bit of you know, spray oil or
something, and bake it on like a tray with

84
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:49,133
a rack like this. I'm going to use this for
draining, but you can just bake it on here

85
00:07:50,033 --> 00:07:56,037
at 450 for about fifteen minutes. It's not
going to get like as delectably golden brown

86
00:07:56,037 --> 00:08:01,128
as these, but it will be crispy and cooked
and it will be much healthier than this or

87
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:09,028
a McDonald's filet-o-fish. So, I should have
taken a note myself, but... I just need to

88
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:11,093
stand up straighter.

89
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:18,093
Okay, there we go, now we're talking. So like
I said, just drain it on a little rack over

90
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:26,052
here. And I'll go ahead and fry my other fish.
While those are cooling, I'll microwave a

91
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:31,128
couple little hamburger buns to soften them
up and get them nice and squishy like the

92
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:39,028
ones at McDonalds. Okay. Okay, we're ready,
to have fish sandwiches, fish sandwiches,

93
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,075
fish sandwiches. I've got a little bun here,
like I said I just stuck it in the microwave

94
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:46,090
for literally ten seconds and it gets nice
and pliable and warm.

95
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,074
I'm going to top it with some American cheese.
Now at McDonalds they're skimpy little bastards

96
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:54,151
and they only give you half a slice of cheese.
What the hell is American about that? So we're

97
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:59,076
going to go ahead and do a whole slice, thank
you very much. And then we'll top it with

98
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:06,076
a little fish patty. Let's see, this one looks
good and a big, big hefty blob of your tartar

99
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:14,137
sauce. They do like this much there. I know,
because I just ate one the other day. And

100
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:20,080
then there you go. There's a gorgeous filet-o-fish
sandwich for you. Then of course you would

101
00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:21,073
put the top on and eat it.

102
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:26,081
If you like this recipe, also check out my
Chick-Fil-A knock-off. If you like fried meat

103
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:31,125
sandwiches and if you don't want to watch
that one, then you can watch my chicken fried

104
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:37,031
steak video because I do the same, a very
similar cracker crust and you can just see

105
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:41,057
how gorgeous it is. It's delicious. Fried
meats for the win, right people?

106
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:48,057
Okay. Give it a taste. That's what's supposed
to happen, that little--shit, that's good.

107
00:09:54,024 --> 00:10:01,024
Do I have something on my face? I do. Alright,
there you go, homemade filet-o-fish, way better

108
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:07,083
than McDonalds. I hope you try this, I hope
you love it. Please leave a comment below

109
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,181
and visit me at hilahcooking.com for principle
recipes. See you guys later, thanks for watching.

110
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:17,081
Bye-bye. I'm going to try to fit this whole
thing in my mouth. That's not going to happen,

111
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:25,150
sorry.
