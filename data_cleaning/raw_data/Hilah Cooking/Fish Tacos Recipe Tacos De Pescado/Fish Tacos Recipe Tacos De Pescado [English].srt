00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey dudes, I'm Hilah and today I'm Hilah cooking
and remaking the second

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:06,107
recipe video I ever did. That is Fish Tacos.
Can you believe it's been that

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,686
long since I ate some Fish Tacos? I mean,
come on.

4
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:13,740
So, this is a great summertime recipe. It
comes together in a cinch. It's

5
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:16,085
nice. It's refreshing. It's light so that
you can keep your beach body

6
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:19,146
figure. It's totally working on me. So I'm
really excited to share it with

7
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:27,046
you, especially because that old video, the
sound was totally f'ed up,

8
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:31,089
dudes.

9
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:38,089
Time to get hoppin' on the Fish Taco toppin'.
Taco Toppin' was actually the

10
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:45,029
old Aztec name for this. So I'm going to update
my slaw a little bit. I've

11
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:49,060
got some green cabbage that I shredded up,
some white onion that sliced,

12
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:55,012
and some jicama. So this is a root. It's starchy.
It has a texture like a

13
00:00:55,066 --> 00:01:02,066
raw potato, but it's sweet like an apple and
mild. So it adds a nice little

14
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:09,067
flavor to the slaw. I've got that in there.
And then I'm going to add some

15
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:09,078
salt.

16
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:13,106
This is a super duper simple coleslaw recipe.
All we're going to use is

17
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:18,085
salt and lime juice to get it softened up
to get that cabbage releasing

18
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:24,126
some water, and get it nice and tender so
we can eat it raw. Everyone's on

19
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:31,635
this raw diet thing. Whatever. But some raw
vegetables obviously are good

20
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:37,948
for you. Like salad. Like celery sticks. Like
carrot sticks.

21
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,680
So that's about a teaspoon of salt. I'll get
that tossed around with my

22
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:48,869
tongs. You could use your hands also, nature's
tongs. Use a bigger bowl

23
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:54,085
than I did so you don't have to worry about
it flopping out everywhere. So

24
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,160
salt's coating everything.

25
00:01:56,006 --> 00:02:01,103
Now we're just going to squeeze in some lime
juice. And if you are be

26
00:02:02,057 --> 00:02:06,146
stricken by horribly high lime prices, you
can use some lemon juice. Just

27
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:10,123
don't tell anyone. I really expected more
juice from that lime, since I

28
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:18,023
paid 33 cents for it. Hopefully that was close
to two tablespoons. We'll

29
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:23,112
get that tossed around. Toss that salad. And
then I'm going to add some

30
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:31,012
cilantro, or fresh coriander, if you are British.
And I don't bother

31
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:35,179
pulling off the stems for cilantro. I just
chop it up really really fine

32
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,145
because there's a lot of flavor in the stems
actually.

33
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:44,052
So I can see with my little eyes that the
cabbage has already started to

34
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:47,064
soften up just with that little bit of motion
in the ocean, so I'm just

35
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:49,993
going to set this aside and work on some other
stuff and just leave it at

36
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,661
room temperature, and I'll show you what it
looks like when we're done.

37
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,528
You'll be amazed. You'll be like wow, you're
a genius.

38
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,887
For the mayonnaise sauce, this is an update,
I've got some mayonnaise here.

39
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm going to add some minced chipotle peppers.
So chipotle and adobo, they

40
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:15,483
come in a little can, it's a dollar, and it's
the adobo sauce that's sweet

41
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,690
and slightly vinegary, but mostly sweet. And
hot. There's smoked jalapeno

42
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,978
peppers, and then they're put in this adobo
sauce. So whenever I get a jar

43
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,530
home, I like to transfer it into a jar and
keep it in the fridge, and then

44
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,232
they'll stay like that forever.

45
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:39,709
So they're pretty spicy. I'm going to start
with half of one and just mince

46
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,148
it up, and it pretty much just turns into
a paste as you're mincing it. I'm

47
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:48,104
just going to put all of it in there. I like
it spicy. All minced up, it's

48
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:55,813
about a tablespoon of chipotle in adobo. Plop
that in with some mayonnaise.

49
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:59,980
Lick your finger, because who cares. I'm only
cooking for myself and this

50
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:00,134
guy, and he doesn't give a sh**.

51
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:08,034
I'm going to add some lime juice. So about
a tablespoon of that. And I'm

52
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:13,062
going to add a little bit of malt vinegar,
which is really really good on

53
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:20,062
fried fish. It smells vinegary, but it's nutty
and sweet. Anyway, if you

54
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,681
can't find this, then you can just add some
more lime juice. It's just

55
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,746
going to add some more tartness. But also
it's nice because of the whole

56
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,580
fish connection. Then we're going to mix this
up.

57
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:36,827
So the sourness of the vinegar and the lime
juice should balance out the

58
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:41,300
heat of the chipotle pretty well, but if it's
a little bit too spicy for

59
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:45,052
you, I would recommend that you add a little
bit of honey or sugar to

60
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:52,349
temper that heat a little bit. But this tastes
pretty good to me. Thumbs

61
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:53,710
up.

62
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:57,250
So we'll just set this aside and start working
on the fish. So, I haven't

63
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,901
changed anything from the original recipe
as far as the seasoning and the

64
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,072
spices that I'm putting on it. So the two
main things here are some cumin

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,685
seeds and some anise. This is not star anise.
It's just anise seed. And it

66
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,178
has a licoricey fennely flavor. If you can't
find it you can leave it out,

67
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,080
but it goes really really nicely with fish.
And then whole cumin seed. So

68
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:21,024
those two.

69
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:25,653
And some chili powder. And when I say chili
powder, me, personally, I just

70
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:31,902
mean ground up ancho chilies, or ground up
New Mexico chilies. I don't mean

71
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,960
commercial brand of chili powder that has
garlic salt and all that stuff

72
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:37,152
mixed into it, although if that's what you
can find, and that's what you

73
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:41,701
have in your pantry, that is totally totally
fine. Please don't worry about

74
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:42,197
it.

75
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:47,532
A little mortar and pestle. You can use pre-ground
spices if you want, but

76
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:52,305
you know me, I like to make things hard on
myself. So put our whole spices

77
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:59,539
in and crush them up. Good. And then I'm going
to add my chili powder. It's

78
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:07,909
already ground. And salt and pepper. What's
life without salt and pepper.

79
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:16,960
You wouldn't have that song, Push It, for
one thing. Mixed up.

80
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:23,096
Now for the breading part, I'm just using
some cornmeal. If you are in

81
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:32,129
another country that's not the best country
in the world, America. If you

82
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:36,436
are in another country and you don't have
cornmeal, you can use fine

83
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:41,499
polenta. It's basically the same thing. We're
going to add this to that,

84
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:44,588
and mix it around. It's combined.

85
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,468
Now we're going to do the fish. So, I do the
fish last so I don't have to

86
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:56,179
wash my cutting board between. I'm not getting
raw fish juice on things.

87
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,602
I'm using some wild snapper, but you can use
pretty much any lightish fish.

88
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,932
You could probably use salmon or something
like that too. Any old kind of

89
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:12,300
fish that you like. And I asked the fish monger
if he could skin it for me,

90
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,996
so these are skinless and boneless. So, I'm
just going to cut them into

91
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,558
pieces, maybe an inch wide by however long
it is, so that usually ends up

92
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,062
being about the right size to go into a taco.

93
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:29,686
So you got your fish chunks. Now we're just
going to toss them around in

94
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,295
this cornmeal mixture just to coat it. We
don't really need anything to

95
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:40,194
help adhere the cornmeal, just the moisture
from the fish will keep it on

96
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,509
there. And you can do this fish coating part
ahead of time too and just

97
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,577
cover them and leave them in the fridge up
to a couple hours and then it'll

98
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,224
help the coating stick on better too. But
you can leave them sit for

99
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:52,601
awhile.

100
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,228
So the fish is all coated. I'm just going
to let it sit here in my little

101
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:03,550
dish for just as long as it takes to heat
up a skillet with some oil in it

102
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:08,254
and then we'll get to fry in the fish. Fish
fry party. So you want to heat

103
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:15,520
your pan up over medium, or medium high heat,
and then add maybe two

104
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:19,451
tablespoons of canola oil or corn oil or peanut
oil, something neutral,

105
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,919
with a high smoke point. Swirl it around like
a lava lamp. Don't get all

106
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,256
high and get distracted.

107
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,045
And then you want to cook your fish in two
batches. Cook the smaller pieces

108
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,643
with the smaller pieces and the bigger ones
with the bigger ones. And when

109
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,092
you lay it in the hot oil, lay it away from
you, just in case, so you don't

110
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:52,569
splatter hot oil on your beautiful face and
make Jesus very sad. So they'll

111
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,560
probably just take about two to three minutes
on each side depending on the

112
00:08:57,056 --> 00:08:57,093
size.

113
00:08:57,093 --> 00:09:01,144
And with thicker filets like this snapper,
you might need to do more than

114
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:09,044
just two sides and go ahead and get the sides,
sides cooked as well. Once

115
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,782
they're nice and brown on every side we can
take them out. And when you

116
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:23,529
break one open the inside should be flaky,
like that.

117
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:32,992
And these are super duper hot right now so
you want to let them cool off

118
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,710
for a few minutes, and while that's happening
we can heat up our tortillas.

119
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:46,259
Put some of that on there. Some of our chipotle
mayo sauce.

120
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:56,081
So if you're interested, be sure to check
