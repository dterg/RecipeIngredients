00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:00,070
our in Indio is bring this to a boil
when it boils on a

17
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:05,014
turn the heat off and just let sit for
about 10 minutes to get

18
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:08,077
and reconstituted I'm actually gonna
move this

19
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:11,716
this background while that happens

20
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:15,610
to a little magic switcheroo here

21
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:19,106
and work on new around here totally look
like

22
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:23,305
a number to hear right what this says
has not returned

23
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,428
and Sam trees assets from Fresh Mex
can't resist that urge

24
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,052
was gonna cook this overs or to
medium-high heat until

25
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,171
its cooked through and in relief fine
crumbles you can totally leave this out

26
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:40,003
and I've mean these vegetarian before
and they're

27
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,990
just delicious but am had some trees are
so many at it

28
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,298
dump

29
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:52,780
want most the fat has released you can
be pretty sure that it am

30
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,160
almost cut them in at some diced onion
and I just wanna

31
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:01,023
soften us a little bit i Sol I still
wanna keep sounds like they're

32
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:05,096
crunch integrity and the onion that

33
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,814
maybe not like Foley rocks onions

34
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,260
Alito like it 2009 like this every fight
for SP as long as you have

35
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:17,029
the chili sauce and the potatoes and he
then you could totally dissed by Kanye

36
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:21,074
Angeles ass and make enchiladas concern
for breakfast with an eye on top

37
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,075
I dealt give to Shia

38
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:28,101
okay SR water on that show is boiling

39

that's great I'm gonna drop in a couple
clubs

40
00:02:32,024 --> 00:02:35,039
a brother like just like that you

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,048
to look back on it turn it off and just
let it sit there for 10 minutes to get

42
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:43,101
softened up companions are going just
barely translucent we go ahead and turn

43
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:44,009
the heat off

44
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,088
and I've got to red potatoes here that I
and boil

45
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:50,092
a couple days ago and then peel

46
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:53,150
and has cut into pretty big kid and then
also can add San

47
00:02:54,005 --> 00:03:00,005
baby spinach tear it up there year

48
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:05,031
rose I want my money back but like I
said yeah like this is totally still

49
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,112
hurting me know if you leave

50
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:10,078
you know just leave the jury's out to
meet is not

51
00:03:10,078 --> 00:03:13,106
in 10 role integral now and take it out

52
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:18,012
it's not and necessary for the SP to
work just a little

53
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:22,077
extra bonus test results and you make
any on I just a plan that for 2014

54
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:26,102
pass it on can a mash-up those potato
chunks a little bit

55
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:31,091
to help this feeling stick together and
that's just going to make it easier to

56
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,159
rollout do

57
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:38,155
Hannah laughing a man to the filling is
some crumbled up could he had she is

58
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:43,064
and this is a Mexican she is it's very
firm and salty

59
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:48,084
Penn around me and a man's dick cats
furman faulty ok anyway

60
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:51,121
that I'm just imagining that merman have
perpetual by respecting my

61
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,077
just a little bit that maybe announcer
cell dad and I saltiness

62
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:59,081
so whenever any other saltiness because
between the trees and the QWERTY however

63
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,165
we've got it made but if you were
leading

64
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:05,068
either one of those out in power went
out a little bit assault mix at around

65
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,187
and this is not a melting cheese it

66
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:10,109
stays in chunks and I just coming it's
soft

67
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:15,010
so add a nice little text rolled by in a
little chewy like

68
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,588
cheese curd kinda feel you can use
either

69
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,160
types to choose to use

70
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:28,335
scam pulling out by the tip good at it

71
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,504
and let all that feeds dropout you could
leave a man if you want and

72
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,781
a release by fast that i dont me this
isn't going to be like super

73
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,710
hi the papers have a really nice free
Fleener

74
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,149
and a little garlic cloves that I drop
down

75
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:46,978
so they'll still have a little bit %uh
Veron after them but they're not gonna

76
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,462
be like so

77
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:52,914
sharp and spicy so

78
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:56,840
add to start with about a half a cup

79
00:04:56,084 --> 00:05:00,111
the soaking liquid and that's why I
wrenched these papers of first because

80
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,650
you want to be able to use this liquid

81
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,620
but not at Fulham weird gross ship just
give it a renowned

82
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:09,083
huh

83
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:13,100
important safety net when year and
blending hot things in a blender

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,004
pressure buildup and I'll in control of
so make sure that you are allowed to

85
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:18,073
like a vent

86
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:21,078
to space RF leaving a little thing like
that or if you don't have like a little

87
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,035
cap you can

88
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:26,052
just cover the blender with like a towel
or something

89
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:29,130
double that say don't spider your hand
with hot liquid okay

90
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:35,010
safety lesson over

91
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:39,069
world I've now it's loud okay gonna
check the conflict in

92
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:44,093
CE I don't pretty good melville is she
also I'm gonna add a little bit assaults

93
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,189
unique or did he spare cell and that's
it are soft is done

94
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:53,091
so nevertheless magically and goes over
there

95
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,018
and then for that anti-apartheid got
some quite Proteus

96
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:00,116
typically are traditionally there sort
of like

97
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:05,017
warmed up and softened and some warm why
all the freeroll the

98
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:08,059
enchiladas I have a cheer white
chromatid

99
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,070
and can actually spray them up with a
little bit us pretty well

100
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:14,020
food to through

101
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,151
who clue

102
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:23,146
who and then stick on a migraine for
about 30 seconds and you will see how

103
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:25,055
beautifully pliable they become

104
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:29,121
okay says see these are nice and hot

105
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:33,085
softie now your mileage may vary my
needed put in for a little bit longer

106
00:06:33,085 --> 00:06:34,089
sixty seconds or so

107
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:38,028
but looks good to me time you put it

108
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:42,092
well above our soft down here and he
just like me

109
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:45,117
dredge each tortilla in a little bit at
the sauce

110
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:49,034
it's going to be like Messi don't wear
your best shirt

111
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:54,121
couple tablespoons earlier filling mmm

112
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:59,082
ship it on that a lot of times when I'm
just making these for Chris and I i

113
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:00,131
Justi like a half batch

114
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:04,094
and I won't even bother like heating up
in the analyst do it on a plate

115
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:11,094
and Mike microwave them or something

116
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:15,264
do

117
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,356
to this last one you gonna do a little
maneuvering

118
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,821
a little Whodini ng to get it covered
but you can't do it

119
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,244
I promise you'll manage more a movie n

120
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:30,727
now it's gonna pour the rest the sauce
over the top well maybe save a little

121
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,524
bit back as it looks really pretty it
when you travel with the and you know a

122
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,386
little bit more sauce

123
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,531
on top in the egg to you K gorgeous
alright method is in heaven

124
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:43,331

128
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:56,708
why doesn't work

129
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,554
but it doesn't work have to use backup

130
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,007
Sherman to get a million comment on me
I'm totally wrong but in my kitchen

131
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,485
I have to use better or the eggs just
stick in the making huge mess

132
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,948
he never over pretty hi he and what this
better

133
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,395
can have it'll get a little for me and
then the phone will subside

134
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,450
don't let me down but her do what I said

135
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,551
field okay I think that on a nap

136
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,470
sort of popping and stuff me almost
about to turn brown

137
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:33,560
that's good

138
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:36,885
30 put a dent in it starts popping like
that that's good it means you're

139
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,490
probably not gonna have your egg stick
to the pan

140
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,105
enough to mean you're probably at some
across the ground that's what I

141
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:45,354
personally like pat down anyone
anti-poaching Yanks or

142
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,485
night cast iron skillet just gonna
sharing it

143
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,660
the handle will get hot eventually if
Ryan much Excel

144
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:57,074
have to be like me and beyond student
turn the heat down

145
00:08:57,074 --> 00:09:00,117
thats having too much so let's get the
bottoms of that

146
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:05,024
white getting like this and then

147
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:08,086
good like that turn the heat off
immediately

148
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:11,094
that residual heat gonna keep cooking
and so it's not like totally done

149
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:15,150
I get my into a lot of money and track

150
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:23,005
