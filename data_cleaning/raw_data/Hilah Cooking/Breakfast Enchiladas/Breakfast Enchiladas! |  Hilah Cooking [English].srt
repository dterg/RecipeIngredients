00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:03,062
Hey, dudes. I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah
Cooking, we're making breakfast enchiladas

2
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:06,141
filled with potatoes and chorizo, topped with
fried eggs with a homemade chili sauce. These

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:12,107
are going to go great with all of your breakfast
margaritas.

4
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:20,007
Alright. Numero uno. That means number one
in Spanish. We're going to make our chili

5
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:32,046
sauce. So, I've got here a couple of dried
pasilla chilies. They're pretty sweet and

6
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:38,087
tasty and delicious. I'm just going to break
the stems off. I've already given them a little

7
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:44,180
rinse, just to get any dust or pesticide residue
or anything like that off of them, since they're

8
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:52,008
not organic. Sorry, Jesus. I'm going to add
about a cup of water or maybe a little more.

9
00:00:55,012 --> 00:01:00,110
All we're going to do is bring this to a boil.
When it boils, I'm going to turn the heat

10
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:07,007
off and just let it sit for about ten minutes
to get reconstituted. So, I'm actually going

11
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:14,007
to move this to this back burner while that
happens. Do a little magic switcharoo here

12
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:20,094
and work on numero two. This totally looks
like a number two here.

13
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:26,168
Alright. What this is is not a turd. It's
some chorizo sausage, some fresh Mexican chorizo

14
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:32,437
sausage. I'm just going to cook this over
sort of a medium-high heat, until it's cooked

15
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:39,056
through and in really fine crumbles. You could
totally leave this out. I've made these vegetarian

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,119
before, and they're just delicious. But I
had some chorizo, so I'm going to add it.

17
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,036
[music].

18
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:53,335
Once most of the fat has released, you can
be pretty sure that it's almost cooked. So,

19
00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:00,490
I'm going to add some diced onion. We just
want to soften this a little bit. I still

20
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:07,049
want to keep some of the crunch integrity
of the onion, but maybe not like fully raw

21
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:11,106
onions. Although, you totally could. It's
also fine that way. This is a very flexible

22
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:16,012
recipe, as long as you have the chili sauce
and the potatoes, and even, you could totally

23
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:20,100
just buy a can of enchilada sauce and make
enchiladas and serve them for breakfast with

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,041
an egg on top. I don't give two shits. Okay.

25
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:31,120
So, our water on the chilies is boiling. That's
great. I'm going to drop in a couple cloves

26
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:37,058
of raw garlic, just like that. Bloop. Put
the lid back on it. Turn it off and just let

27
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:42,159
it sit there for ten minutes to get softened
up. Okay. Onions are getting just barely translucent.

28
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:47,958
Go ahead and turn the heat off. I've got two
red potatoes here that I boiled a couple days

29
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:53,760
ago, and then peeled and just cut into pretty
big cubes. And then, I'm also going to add

30
00:02:53,076 --> 00:03:00,076
some baby spinach. Tear it up a little bit.
Ew. Gross. I want my money back. But like

31
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:09,621
I said, yeah, this is totally still a hearty
meal if you leave the chorizo out. The meat

32
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:16,819
is not integral. I don't know. Take it out.
It's not necessary for the recipe to work.

33
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:21,857
Just a little extra bonus, because chorizo
is the new bacon, y'all. I just declared that

34
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,940
for 2014. Pass it on.

35
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:28,159
Just going to mash up those potato chunks
a little bit to help this filling stick together.

36
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:36,059
That's just going to make it easier to roll
up. Okay. Them the last thing I'm going to

37
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,690
add to the filling is some crumbled up cotija
cheese. This is a Mexican cheese. It's very

38
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:48,093
firm and salty, kind of reminds me of a merman's
dick because it's firm and salty. Okay. Anyway,

39
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:52,136
I'm just imagining that merman have perpetual
boners. But anyway, just a little bit of this,

40
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:57,073
maybe an ounce or so. Just add a nice saltiness.
So, we're not adding any other salt to this

41
00:03:57,073 --> 00:04:01,165
because between the chorizo and the cotija,
we've got it made. But if you were leaving

42
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:05,434
either one of those out, you probably want
to add a little bit of salt. Mix that around.

43
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,250
And this is not a melting cheese. It stays
in chunks, and they just kind of get soft.

44
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:16,694
So, it adds a nice little textural bite in
there, a little chewy cheese curd kind of

45
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,015
feel. You could use other types of cheese
too.

46
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:28,879
Just going to pull them out by the tips. Pull
it out by the tip and let all the seeds drop

47
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,001
out. You could leave them in if you wanted
a really spicy sauce, but I don't know. To

48
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,293
me, this doesn't really need to be like super
hot. These peppers have a really nice fruity

49
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,187
flavor. And the little garlic cloves that
I dropped in. So, they'll still have a little

50
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:52,619
bit of a rawness to them, but they're not
going to be so sharp and spicy. So, I'm going

51
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:59,819
to add, to start with, about a half cup of
this soaking liquid. That's why I rinsed these

52
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,915
peppers off first, because you want to be
able to use this liquid, but not if it's full

53
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:09,972
of weird gross shit, just jizz it around.

54
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:15,030
Important safety note. When you're blending
hot things in a blender, pressure builds up,

55
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:19,311
and the lid can blow off. So, make sure that
you allow it to like vent, just by sort of

56
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,578
leaving a little thing like that. Or if you
don't have like a little cap, you can just

57
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,267
cover the blender with like a towel or something,
doubled up, so you don't splatter your hand

58
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,879
with hot liquid. Okay. Safety lesson over.
Whoa, guys. That was loud. Okay. I'm going

59
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,770
to check the consistency. Alright, that looks
pretty good. Smells delicioso. I'm going to

60
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:48,121
add a little bit of salt, maybe a quarter
teaspoon or so. That's it. Our sauce is done.

61
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:56,021
So, we can get rid of this. Magically, it
goes over there. And then, for the enchilada

62
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,580
part, I've got some corn tortillas. Typically,
or traditionally, they're sort of like warmed

63
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:07,377
up and softened in some warm oil before you
roll the enchiladas. I have a cheer white

64
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,968
girl method, and I'm just going to actually
spray them with a little bit of spray oil.

65
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:19,589
Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. Then,
stick them in the microwave for about 30 seconds,

66
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:29,624
and you will see how beautifully pliable they
become. Okay. See? These are nice and hot

67
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:34,300
and soft. Your mileage may vary. You might
need to put them in for a little bit longer,

68
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:36,094
60 seconds or so. But, looks good to me.

69
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:42,820
So, we're going to put a little bit of our
sauce down here. And then, you just want to

70
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,740
dredge each tortilla in a little bit of this
sauce. It's going to be a little bit messy.

71
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:54,074
Don't wear your best shirt. Couple tablespoons
of your filling. And then, shove it on back.

72
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,876
A lot of times when I'm just making these
for Chris and I, I'll just do like a half

73
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,151
batch, and I won't even bother heating up
in the oven. I'll just do it on a plate and

74
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,501
like, microwave them or something.

75
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:18,059
So, this last one, you've got to do a little
maneuvering, a little Houdini-ing to get it

76
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:28,002
covered, but you can do it. I promise you'll
manage. Alright. Muy bien. Now, I'm just going

77
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,447
to pour the rest of the sauce over the top.
Well, maybe save a little bit back because

78
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:35,112
it looks really pretty when you top it with
egg. You can add a little bit more sauce on

79
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:41,603
top of the egg too. Okay. Gorgeous. Alright.
I'm going to put this in the oven, really

80
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,822
just until I have some eggs fried or poached
or however you want to do them.

81
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:51,716
Bonus video recipe tip. How to fry an egg
in a cast iron skillet. You have to use butter.

82
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,307
Do not screw around with oil and frying eggs
in a cast iron skillet. I have no idea why

83
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:02,058
it doesn't work, but it doesn't work. You
have to use butter. I'm sure I'm going to

84
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:06,506
get a million comments telling me I'm totally
wrong, but in my kitchen, I have to use butter,

85
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,641
or the eggs just stick, and they make a huge
mess. I'm heating this up over pretty high

86
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,377
heat. I'm going to let this butter kind of
-- It'll get a little foamy, and then the

87
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:21,266
foam will subside. Don't let me down, butter.
Do what I said that you'll do.

88
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,176
Okay. I think that's hot enough. It's sort
of popping and stuff. It's maybe almost about

89
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:34,509
to turn brown. That's good. So, if you put
it in, and it starts popping like that, that's

90
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,526
good. It means you're probably not going to
have your eggs stick to the pan. It also means

91
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:42,201
you're probably going to get some little crusty
brown bits, which I personally like. But if

92
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,500
you don't, then you might want to try poaching
your eggs or not using a cast iron skillet.

93
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:51,036
Just kind of shimmy it. The handle will get
hot, eventually, if you're frying a bunch

94
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:57,350
of eggs. So, don't have to be like me and
be all stupid. Turn the heat down if it's

95
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:04,360
popping too much. So, it looks good. The bottom's
all set, white. Get it moving like this, and

96
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:07,205
then boop, like that.

97
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,690
Turn the heat off immediately, because that
residual heat is going to keep cooking it.

98
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:16,468
So, it's not like totally done while I get
my enchiladas out of the oven. Alright. Enchiladas

99
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:24,089
are done. Oops. I scrunched it, but that's
OK. It's going to taste awesome. Then, I'm

100
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:32,769
going to cover it with a, hopefully, still
runny egg. Come on. I'll just do that. Perfect.

101
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,240
Okay. There you go. Breakfast enchiladas.
I cannot wait to dig in.

102
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:45,024
I have many other enchilada recipes on my
website and videos. And also, check out my

103
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:49,980
breakfast playlist, if you are so inclined.
Let's just go ahead and see if the egg yolk

104
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:56,098
is still runny. Hey. It's not runny, exactly,
but it's moist. Why does that word gross everyone

105
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,024
out so much? Okay.

106
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:06,537
Get all this good stuff. I'm just going to
take a big old honking bite. God damn it.

107
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:13,699
If I can. Fork. My fork is traitor-ing me.
That is what I'm talking about. This is what

108
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:20,186
I want for breakfast if I ever come to stay
at your house, like impromptu like bed and

109
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,607
breakfast session. This is what I want you
to make me. Okay?

Pinch-a-lot-as. Get it?
