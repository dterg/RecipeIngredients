Hey dudes, I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking
I've got a new variation

2
00:00:03,239 --> 00:00:07,590
on potato salad for you. It's a spicy potato
salad, because I posted it on

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,718
Instagram and a lot of people were like hey,
I want to know how to make

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:14,284
that. So, I'm going to show you just in time
for the weekend for all of you

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,320
who are cooking and grilling out some stuff
that you're not even inviting

6
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:24,032
me to, you jerks.

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:32,011
Okay. For the potato salad I've got some potatoes.
They're in the pot. I

8
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:39,084
already boiled them. I'm pretty sure you can
figure out how to do that.

9
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:41,165
Meanwhile, we're going to make this dressing.
I've got some mayonnaise in

10
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,404
here. If you don't want to use mayonnaise
you can use sour cream.

11
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,130
I'm going to add some apple cider vinegar.
This is one of my favorite

12
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:52,052
vinegars, and I like to get the one that's
unpasteurized because it's got a

13
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,021
lot of really good probiotics in it. That
means that it's good for your

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,600
intestines.

15
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:01,084
A little bit of olive oil and some mustard.
This is a fun little mustard

16
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:05,125
that Suzanne sent me from Germany, and it's
got pink peppercorns and green

17
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:10,107
peppercorns in it. If you can't find this,
which I've never seen it in the

18
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,033
US so I wouldn't be surprised, you can just
use some kind of brown deli

19
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:17,035
mustard. It would be very similar. About a
tablespoon of that.

20
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:23,040
Because this is spicy we're going to add some
chili powder. This is just

21
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:28,027
ground New Mexico chili powder without any
additional stuff in it. Good,

22
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:32,092
hefty dose of that. It's not terribly spicy,
but it's got a nice earthy

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,106
flavor.

24
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:40,815
Then, for the spice, a little bit of cayenne,
and that's optional. Leave it

25
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,890
up to your taste. That was a few dashes.

26
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:48,122
Some black pepper. This has got multiple types
of peppers in it. Super fun.

27
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:56,022
Some salt. We'll get this whisked together.

28
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:03,869
Okay. We can set that aside and cut up our
potatoes. I boiled some red

29
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:11,134
fingerling potatoes. That's fingerling, gentlemen.
I'm going to leave the

30
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:16,118
skins on. You could use some red new potatoes
or something like that, too,

31
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:20,026
or some white potatoes. White, or red, or
Yukon gold, those are all really

32
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,190
nice for potato salad. Let's see, maybe cut
them lengthwise, just basically

33
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:24,106
bite-size pieces.

34
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:30,098
It's best to dress the potatoes, mix it up
with the dressing while the

35
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:33,154
potatoes are still a little bit warm, because
that way they'll absorb more

36
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:38,062
of the flavors from the dressing. Once the
potatoes are in there we've got

37
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:43,051
some celery. You can cut this up any old size
you want to. I like to cut

38
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:50,051
them lengthwise and then in sort of smallish
squares.

39
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:57,077
Add that to the bowl, then I'm going to add
some red onion that I've diced

40
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:02,159
up. I tried to kind of keep all the vegetables
except the celery red. Get

41
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:07,150
it? Because spicy, red, devils, cupids.

42
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:14,041
Okay. Some fresh red bell pepper. These are
peppadew peppers which look

43
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:18,090
like cherry peppers but they're not really
very spicy at all. They're

44
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:23,041
usually packed in kind of a sweetish brine.
They've got a nice flavor

45
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:29,401
profile. It's pretty complex. You can buy
them in a jar, or if your grocery

46
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,691
store has one of those, like, fancy olive
bars they're usually also there.

47
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,870
I've got a couple of those.

48
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:40,876
You could totally use some cherry peppers
instead, although they're going

49
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,678
to be hotter than these, so keep that in mind.
Or, sometimes you can even

50
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,230
find pickled red jalapenos.

51
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:52,061
Perfect, that's all in there. Then, stir it
around. This spoon is

52
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:57,114
ridiculously small for this job. What am I,
an idiot? Don't answer that.

53
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:02,058
Here we go. To me this kind of potato salad
with the spiciness and the

54
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:07,607
extra vinegar goes really, really well with
grilled meats and barbecue,

55
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,010
heavy meats like beef brisket or lamb.

56
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:18,001
There we go. There's our spicy potato salad.

59
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:33,061

be superb alongside this

60
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:38,130
potato salad. Try that this weekend, send
me a picture of what you made,

61
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:46,003
and I will love you forever, with my clothes
on.

62
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:59,129
Did I go out of frame? Sorry.

63
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:03,374
That's delicious. It's tangy and refreshing
and spicy, and I love it, and I

64
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,154
hope you try it. I think you're really going
to like it.
