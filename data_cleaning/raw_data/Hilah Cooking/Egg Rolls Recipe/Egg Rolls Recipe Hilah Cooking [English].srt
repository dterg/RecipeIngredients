00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:03,647
Hey, dudes. I'm Hilah, and today on Hilah
Cooking, I'm making Chinese egg rolls, which

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:08,300
might more appropriately be called Chinese-American
egg rolls because they're a complete bastardization

3
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:13,065
of original Chinese spring rolls, I'm sure.
But anyway, these are great for snacks, appetizers,

4
00:00:13,092 --> 00:00:17,097
or even Easter because they're called egg
rolls. Get it? That'll really throw your guests

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:25,042
for a loop. They'll be like, 'What the f--
is Chinese food doing here with the ham?'

6
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:36,509
Okay. The first thing we're going to do is
make our filling. So, these have a precooked

7
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,085
filling that you will cook it, and then cool
it before we fill the egg rolls. I'm going

8
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:50,085
to add a little bit of oil to my pan and start
sauteing. I've got some super, very, very

9
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:57,096
finely minced celery and onion here. So, while
that's going, I've got also here about a half

10
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:03,100
a pound of ground pork. You can use ground
turkey, or you can leave out the meat completely

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,004
and add some more vegetables if you want to
also. I'm going to add to this -- This bowl,

12
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:15,066
I've got some brown sugar, some corn starch,
and some minced garlic and ginger.

13
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:19,144
So, when you add corn starch to ground meat
like this, it kind of helps lock in the moisture.

14
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:26,070
So the meat doesn't dry out, and it helps
it sort of bind together. So, it's serving

15
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:33,007
two purposes. I'm just going to mix this in
with the ground meat here. Also going to add

16
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:37,065
about a tablespoon of soy sauce to this and
some pepper. I'm going to use white pepper,

17
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:43,114
but you can use black pepper or red pepper
if you want it a little bit spicier, and a

18
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,783
little bit of salt also. I'm going to add
a little bit of salt to these vegetables too,

19
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,590
to draw some of that moisture out, to sweat
them a little bit. They'll soften up a little

20
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:54,108
quicker.

21
00:01:55,008 --> 00:02:02,008
And then, just get our meat mixed up and add
that to the skillet also. Then, we just want

22
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:08,493
to stir it around, break the meat up as much
as you can, and eventually, it'll sort of

23
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:15,979
come into really, really tiny little crumbles.
So, keep an eye on that and have a brew while

24
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:25,025
you're waiting, because nothing goes with
egg rolls like beer. Right? You could also

25
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:30,056
have water, but hey. Look. Tecate Light. I'm
saving calories on my beer so that I can have

26
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:34,064
more fried egg rolls later. Beautiful.

27
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:40,065
Okay. Just a few minutes later, it looks like
this. I'm going to turn the heat off. You

28
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:45,065
just want to make sure that any big chunks
of meat are sort of broken up. You want, really,

29
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:52,065
a very fine filling for these egg rolls. Then,
transfer it to a plate. You can use a baking

30
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,770
sheet or something. We just want to spread
it out so that it cools off faster. If there's

31
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:06,081
any oil left in the bottom of your pan, you
can try to keep that behind. We'll use that

32
00:03:06,081 --> 00:03:11,090
to cook the cabbage also. Okay. We'll set
that aside.

33
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:18,819
Then, back in the same skillet. I'm going
to add a tiny bit more oil, and we'll add

34
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:24,474
the cabbage. So, this is shredded Napa cabbage.
I just sliced it really, really finely. You

35
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,650
can use regular old green cabbage too. That'll
give you more sort of texture inside your

36
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:35,071
egg roll, and that's more common in restaurants.
I don't know. I had Napa cabbage. So, I'm

37
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:41,050
using Napa cabbage. Either one is fine. You
can also add bean sprouts and things like

38
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:41,604
that.

39
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,980
So, we're just going to saute this until the
cabbage is wilted. It shouldn't take very

40
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:55,098
long at all. Okay. So, cabbage getting nice
and wilted. We don't want to get it too soft

41
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:01,634
because you want to keep a little bit of texture,
and it'll still continue to cook, even after

42
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,510
you've turned the heat off. So, this looks
pretty good. The leafy parts are nice and

43
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:11,890
soft, but the stemmy parts are still a little
crispy. So, I'm going to turn that off, and

44
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,417
I'm going to add some water chestnuts. These
is just like -- These is just like-- A can

45
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:24,050
of water chestnuts that I drained and minced
finely.

46
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:28,027
And then, I'm also going to add some mushrooms.
These are dried Shiitake mushrooms that I've

47
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:34,206
just had soaking in water for about an hour.
Wood ear mushrooms are, like those black ones

48
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,520
that are really firm, are also commonly used
in egg rolls. These are a little bit easier

49
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:47,159
to find, usually. So, squeeze the water out.
Then, I'm just going to mince up these mushrooms

50
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,597
too. And then, finally to this, I'm going
to add a tablespoon of regular, all purpose

51
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:03,389
flour and mix that in. That's just going to
help the filling stay kind of firm. As it

52
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:09,912
cools, it'll thicken it up. So, it'll sort
of make a mass that you can form into little

53
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:11,803
egg rolls.

54
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:19,289
I'm going to spread this out on top of the
meat mix. Then, we'll just put this whole

55
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:28,437
thing in the fridge and let it get super chilled.
You can make the filling a day ahead of time,

56
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:33,568
even two days ahead of time, which is muy
excelente when you've had a lot of brews.

57
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:41,099
Okay. Time to roll these mofos. This is just
about half the mixture. It's cooled off totally.

58
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:49,210
These are my egg roll wrappers. You can find
these in the frozen section, usually, of pretty

59
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:56,021
much any major grocery store. You just want
to thaw them out, and then keep the rest of

60
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:05,028
them covered while you're rolling them so
they don't dry out. It dries out pretty quickly.

61
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:12,469
So, there's two here. God damn it. They stick
together. Stick together like a hand in glove.

62
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,580
These egg roll wrappers are the best of friends.
Okay. It's going on my album, guys. Stay tuned.

63
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,597
Stay iTuned. Just kidding. Okay.

64
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:28,180
So, you want to get a big spoonful, maybe
like a quarter cup or so of your mixture.

65
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:35,729
Put it pretty much right in the center, maybe
a little bit below the center, but pretty

66
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:42,217
much just right on, bros. And then, roll the
bottom up. What I like to do is kind of take

67
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:50,009
it over, and then pull it back. Did you see
how I did that? Did you see how I did that?

68
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:56,171
So that it gets a nice little tight log. Fold
this side over. Fold this side over. Then,

69
00:06:57,071 --> 00:07:04,071
in this little bowl, I've got just a mixture
of plain flour and water, about equal parts,

70
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:11,869
maybe a little bit more water. It's not important
really. Just use your finger to go. I like

71
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:20,033
to sort of get these sides here, like the
envelope sides, and then the little point

72
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:27,033
also. This is going to kind of glue it together.
Then, just roll it over like that. Just like

73
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,270
that. Make sure that you have enough in that
little tippy tip.

74
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:37,536
There we go. So then, we want to set this
aside, seam side down on a plate. You can

75
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:44,779
make these and let them sit for maybe, like,
ten or 15 minutes tops. But eventually, and

76
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:49,605
pretty quickly, the filling, the liquid in
the filling and the oil in the filling is

77
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,080
going to kind of soak through the wrapper.
So, you can't really make them really ahead

78
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:59,827
of time. But like I said, you can make the
filling ahead of time. Then, just roll up

79
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,975
a few. Then, as you're frying the first batch,
you or someone else, ideally you have a little

80
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,702
helper, a little kitchen elf, will be rolling
the next batch. So, it's kind of a fun thing

81
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:15,092
to do if you have friends that like to cook,
to have them over, and let's all make egg

82
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,463
rolls together. You can make some different
fillings. You can put shrimp in them, or you

83
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:26,186
could make vegetarian ones. You could put
carrots in them. You could put whatever in

84
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:26,707
them. Good.

85
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:32,760
So, I'm going to roll up about six of these
while I start heating up my oil. I've got

86
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:39,076
some peanut oil in the skillet, just three-quarters
of an inch or so, to about 365 degrees Fahrenheit.

87
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:47,065
Catch you on the flip side. Wait. There we
go. Cowabunga. Once your oil is around 365,

88
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:55,009
you want to carefully fry your egg rolls in
small batches for one to two minutes on each

89
00:08:55,064 --> 00:09:01,115
side, until golden brown. Now, we're talking.
Be careful not to fry too many at once because

90
00:09:02,015 --> 00:09:05,018
the temperature will drop, and you'll end
up with greasy egg rolls. You'll also run

91
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:12,018
the risk of over boiling your oil. Drain your
egg rolls. Then, I like to put them in a bowl

92
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:19,034
that's lined with a paper towel, sort of upright,
so that the excess oil can drip off. They

93
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,062
actually stay pretty warm this way.

94
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:26,052
Egg rolls are done. What time is it? It's
egg roll time. What time is it? It's time

95
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:32,134
for egg rolls. Those don't rhyme. So, I've
got here some oriental hot mustard powder.

96
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:39,113
You can find this in spice areas. Daisy, quit
being such a bitch. You just mix up the powder

97
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:45,064
with water to the desired consistency. I like
mine a little bit thin so that it's good for

98
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:50,152
dipping. Then, I've also got some sweet chili
sauce. So, if you like this egg roll recipe,

99
00:09:51,052 --> 00:09:56,061
also check out my chimichangas for another
delicious fried treat with a Mexican twist.

100
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:03,083
I also did fresh spring rolls recipe a couple
years ago that aren't fried, and they're way

101
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,152
healthier and almost as delicious.

102
00:10:07,052 --> 00:10:13,103
With that said, let's give this a taste. I
like this hot mustard. It's going to clear

103
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:21,003
out my allergies. It's a fine crunchy egg
roll. There you go. I hope you like this egg

104
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,105
roll recipe. I hope you give it a shot.

111
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:08,116
fried things.
