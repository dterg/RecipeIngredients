14
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:45,015

I've got also here about a half a pound
of ground pork

19
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:04,060

20
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,028
vegetables if you want to

21
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:09,088

all I've got some brown sugar some corn
starch and feminist

23
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:17,166
as garlic and ginger so when you add
cornstarch to ground me like this

24
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:21,079
can help block and moisture to the knee
doesn't dry out

25
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,080
and and and help them find

26
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:27,073
together cell serving two purposes gonna
make this

27
00:01:28,045 --> 00:01:32,054
with that Grammy here other than

28
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,664
at a table 13 so I thought further and

29
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:41,080
sound have fair white pepper but black
pepper

30
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:44,967
had 31 a little bit by fear hello there

31
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,058

national here

32
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,080
of that moisture out but the little bit
both of and at a little quicker

33
00:01:53,008 --> 00:02:00,008
man guitar meet next Sat and add that to
the skillet

34
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:06,647
of I'll we're just gonna start around
break than the other much as you can

35
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,330
and eventually it'll kinda come into
really really

36
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:14,114
tiny little crumble so

37
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:18,017
keep an eye on now and

38
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:21,055
have Abril while you're waiting because

39
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:25,124
nothing goes with enrollment fee right
because I have

40
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:30,042
water but hey look scottie like I'm
saving Kalyanaraman beers that I can

41
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:30,100
have more

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
fried a world leader beautiful okay just
a few minutes later it looks like this

43
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,028
in turn the heat off

44
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:43,054
and you just wanna make sure that any
big chunks in me

45
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:46,078
are sorta broken out you want really a
very find

46
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:50,707
filling for these egg rolls then

47
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,260
no transfer to a plate is a baking sheet
or something

48
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:58,043
we just wanna spread it out so that it
cools off

49
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:02,125
faster there's any oil left in about a
mere pan you can

50
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:06,714
try to like keep that behind millions
that

51
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:10,900
cook the cabbage also okay about aside

52
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:13,238
and then back in the same skillet

53
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,860
had a tiny and more oil

54
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:20,525
animal add that cabbage so this is a

55
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,590
shredded napa cabbage artist's life that
really really finally

56
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:27,061
you can use a regular old green cabbage
too and that'll give you

57
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:31,126
more sort of texture and find your egg
roll and that's more common in

58
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:35,093
restaurants pet and am I had napa
cabbage

59
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:40,117
using cabbage either one fucking you can
also add like bean sprout from things

60
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:41,616
like that

61
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,360
so we're just gonna stock hey there

62
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:49,118
until the cabbage is well to it
shouldn't take very long at all

63
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:53,167
okay so cavett getting

64
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,420
nice and well said you don't want to get

65
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:00,128
to thought of the UN keep a low and
texture and it'll will continue to curb

66
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:04,487
even after you turn the heat off for
this looks pretty get the

67
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,010
sleepy part sir presence of but that any
parts are so little crispy

68
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:13,004
them in turn on/off and I had a fam

69
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,092
water chestnuts and this is just like
these you'd like

70
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:19,125
at Canon water chestnut but I drained
and

71
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:26,034
min finally and then I must have an
absolute mushrooms in either

72
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:29,091
and dried she talkin mushrooms that I
just had soaking in water

73
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:33,156
for about an hour and Outwood ear
mushrooms I like this black ones that

74
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:34,147
are really firm

75
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:40,099
are also commonly used an egg rolls
either a little bit easier to find

76
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,103
usually cell squeeze the water out

77
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,043
and minerals that meant that these
measures

78
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:51,084
tip

79
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:54,283
and then finally to the a man at a table
spoon

80
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,042
have regular all-purpose flour and mix
that and and that's just gonna help the

81
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:00,860
filling

82
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:03,175
pants taken a firm as it cools little

83
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:08,584
taken an absolute alternate make an ass
I'm Matthew can

84
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:15,120
formed a little girl up

85
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:19,281
gonna spread this out on top a the meet
met

86
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,560
up analyst

87
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,060
put this whole thing in the fridge and
when it get super chilled you can make

88
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:28,775
the filling and they had a tiny even two
days ahead of time

89
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,664
which is really excellent a when you've
had a lot have

90
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,020
for is okay time to roll these mofos

91
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,033
and this is just gonna happen next year
its

92
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:45,080
cool lopped how Italy these are my egg
roll wrappers so these you can find

93
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,034
these in the frozen section usually

94
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:51,044
have pretty much any major grocery store

95
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:55,803
and you just want to father up

96
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,860
and then and keep the rest of them

97
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:03,045
covered while you're rolling them so
they don't dry out

98
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,824
that dries out pretty quickly smashed to
hear

99
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,080
cad dement they stick together

100
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:17,077
stick together like a Hiddink letter B
grower rappers are the best defense

101
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,146
K clam out on guys state and

102
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:24,285
day I tuned just getting event so

103
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,714
you wanna get a big spoon falling be
like quarter cup or so

104
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:32,924
your mixture pretty much right in the
center maybe a little bit

105
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,740
below the center but pretty much just

106
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:39,079
right on Bros an eerie and

107
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:44,163
role bottom at and what I like to do can
take it over

108
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:50,398
and then pull it back to DC I didn't
think

109
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,575
so that it gets a nice little tight log

110
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,634
fold this site over for that fight over

111
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,270
man and the form below I've got just to
make sure have

112
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:03,236
play not flour and water and

113
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,120
about equal parts maybe a little bit
more water it's not

114
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:10,040
important really am just use your

115
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:13,063
finger to go or

116
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,238
I liked it exhorted kit the sides here
like that in the lab science and then a

117
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:19,930
little

118
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:23,158
points also this is gonna come to glue
it together

119
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:27,237
and then just roll it over like

120
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,846
that just like that make sure that you
have enough and that little tidbit air

121
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,400
Mary S an arrest other side seam side
down on a plate

122
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:41,020
you can make these make him unlike

123
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:44,133
let him step really Tanner 15 minutes
top

124
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:48,050
but eventually and pretty quickly the
feeling

125
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:51,324
the liquid in the filling in oil in
Philly is going to soak the wrappers to

126
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:51,863
you

127
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,330
you can't really make them like really
ahead of time but like I said you can

128
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,682
make the Philly ahead a time

129
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,400
and then just roll up a few and then as

130
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:04,273
your frying the first batch you or
someone else

131
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,720
ideally you have a little helper a
little kitchen of

132
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:11,141
well the rolling the next batch so it's
kinda fun thing to do if you had like

133
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:14,430
friends like to cut to have them over
and

134
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:17,592
let's all make eggrolls together to make
different fillings you could put shrimp

135
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:19,180
venom

136
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:22,019
or you could make vegetarian one

137
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:25,137
you could put carrots in am

138
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:30,395
you could pit whatever in an can
tomorrow about fixing these

139
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,620
well I start heating up my oil on S&P no
oil in the skillet

140
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:37,139
and just and three-quarters of an inch
or so and took

141
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,076
there about three sixty-five degrees
Fahrenheit

142
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:44,115
kitchen the flip said way there we go

143
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:49,099
calamander Prince Charles around 365
doing carefully

144
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,124
fry and growth in small batches

145
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:56,087
for at 12 minutes on each side until
golden brown

146
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,091
our top 10

147
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:02,116
careful not friend to many at once
because the temperature will drop when

148
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,019
you in a bit greasy and growth

149
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,050
and you of the runner-up overflowing
well

150
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,010
training and rolled highlighted

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,038
ball the mine Italian order

152
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:18,110
appraised so that the ECB welcomed
rip-off

153
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,095
actually day on its way ever learn

154
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:26,004
what time is it it n roll time what time

155
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:29,099
it time for egg rolls those don't rhyme
so I've got here stan

Aurion tall hot mustard powder

157
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,295
