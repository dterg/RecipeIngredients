00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:03,955
pitted am Highland and how it looking
like I'm in a brand new kitchen so long

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,011
orange carrot top

3
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:08,050
hello friend house with white cabinets
and

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,033
not natural light and looks like rich
people in here

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:14,075
so I'm gonna make some Greek pasta salad
today this is a great thing for our

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:15,108
summertime potlucks

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,035
father's Day is coming out maybe nothing
to take out for that and then

8
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:22,040
after we make the recipe and I give you
act or our new house

9
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:25,116
and tell you a little bit about this one
around the eight

10
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:33,016
way

11
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:39,091
that

12
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,176
thinker hosokawa doesn't need to cook
sound pasta

13
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:45,112
now one thing I've been in touch about
am

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,073
I've got about a quart of water almost
to a boil here you really don't need to

15
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:49,166
use like

16
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:53,087
six quarts water when you're making
pasta Arabic thing about water

17
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:53,866
conservation

18
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,680
online website if you want to go reading
tips now has a wire because it's our

19
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,103
most precious natural resource

20
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,552
an I said that sarcastically but I mean
it so anyway

21
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,190
me about a quart of water to cook two
cups the past hour half a pound

22
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,508
which is what we're gonna do now them
reason that people tell you to use

23
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,751
whole shit on water like that is so that
the positive thing together

24
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:18,830
but as long as your class standing here
for the first minute or so

25
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:21,902
while the pasta goes then you can stir
it around a little bit

26
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,710
then it's not gonna stick together some
absence of my water

27
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,420
so basically just last yr

28
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:32,120
until it comes back to well it'll take
30 seconds to a minute

29
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,037
you can put the lid back on for maybe 10
or 15 seconds to help it

30
00:01:36,055 --> 00:01:40,081
come back to work faster but don't walk
off because it will while or if you do

31
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,113
that

32
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:45,072
so want well I want to set the timer my
pasta package said nine to 11 minutes

33
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:49,360
spot the difference which is 10 and then
subtract two to set it for

34
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:52,059
eight-minute edit

35
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:55,078
guess I've got my dreams while that's
boiling

36
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,917
comes gonna go ahead and when a snap to
but also demands of the is

37
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,665
I don't bother like snapping of the
little string and because I think

38
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,780
they're kinda cute

39
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:08,847
so once you've got all year green beans
snapped

40
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:14,910
just travel all India about one-inch
link now

41
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:17,170
said Amanda Salam Paul getting the hell
outta my way

42
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:21,099
once our timer goes off which is just in
about two minutes man and the

43
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:26,151
green beans and then let the pasta and a
green beans boiled together

44
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,410
for the last two minutes that's gonna
sorta blanche to green beans and let the

45
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:30,620
pasta

46
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,790
finish cooking then you just wanna drain
the pasta and green beans and give them

47
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,868
a quick grounds for some cold water

48
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,640
not return a call of so much as you are
just trying to rinse off the excess

49
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:40,140
starch they'll stick together

50
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:44,020
miners leave those training and think
why did this other stuff

51
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:47,078
kinda propped up said got some fresh
parsley

52
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:52,427
I'm not gonna be to an all about like
not leaving any stands behind no stomach

53
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:53,610
when I'm

54
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:57,117
to serve pull off two big leaves we're
gonna give it a

55
00:02:58,017 --> 00:03:01,022
rough chops just sorta wat up into a
little ball

56
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:07,128
and don't put your fingers and then I've
got some kalamata olives and already

57
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:09,067
chopped up some

58
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,650
sweet peppers and some tomatoes here as
you can see you

59
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:15,144
you can buy a pre sliced kalamata olives
but I find that they get a little bit

60
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:16,092
mushy

61
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:21,109
so I like to buy the ones that are just
petted and Hall and then was gonna

62
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:26,025
cut in half yeah let's just cut in half

63
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:29,047
that's easier for everyone still

64
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:33,106
me I'm you work aren't that dressing so
that's

65
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:39,025

70
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,833
about 2 tablespoons that nah nah nah son

71

white wine vinegar you can use red wine
vinegar you can use

72
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:04,061
cider vinegar someone at a couple to
listen to this

73
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,072
and traditional vinaigrette is

74
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:10,095
three-part well to one part accent like
vinegar and lemon juice

75
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:13,474
I like mine a little bit more forceful

76
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,090
like me then a great to really take
control so I'm gonna do

77
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,218
one to one ratio but feel for you in
just a little bit according to your

78
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:21,392
taste

79
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,030
attack next to her and some

80
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:31,075
black pepper port salts

81
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:34,364
and the real kicker here

82
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,440
some haranguing now and that's what
makes the creek

83
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:43,823
nada whole teaspoon get that next start

84
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:47,960
now let me to grab the have to

85
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:51,120
just down that on i Mees wouldn't spend

86
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:55,065
China hurt your delegate years sweet

87
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,144
viewers to and talk with all around

88
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:03,047
19 at are other vegetables and

89
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:06,097
you know whatever else you want to add
to this cucumbers many

90
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,131
here red onion whatever

91
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:13,260
have a pasta party so this is why to

92
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:17,160
when you making pasta for pasta salad
you wanna under could get just

93
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:21,090
a tiny tiny bit take out he just moments
before it would be tender enough to

94
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:21,082
serve hot

95
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:26,077
because they want to call it off annex
you're gonna credits can absorb sound

96
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:26,138
that

97
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,049
vinaigrette and a makes it way too much
as it has some room to absorb some that

98
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,058
also it would be

99
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:36,064
release on the issue could it completely
before you did that

100
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:40,031
so then once everything's mixed up
together it's cooled off

101
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:43,037
organ and the last thing I want you to
limit you are being in or you can use

102
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,177
some parmesan cheese and sent to you

103
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:49,093
and that some crumbled fettuccine just a
little bit

105
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:56,144

temperature or you can refrigerate it

106
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:00,055
and last in the fridge for a couple a
days metaphor

107
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:05,984

108
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,130
