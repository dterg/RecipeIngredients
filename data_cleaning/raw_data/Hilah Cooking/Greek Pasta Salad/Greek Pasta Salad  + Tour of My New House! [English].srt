Hey Dudes I'm Hilah and today on Hilah Cooking,
look, I'm in a brand new

2
00:00:02,077 --> 00:00:05,166
kitchen. So long orange countertops. Hello,
a brand new house with white

3
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:10,144
cabinets and lots of natural light and looks
like rich people live here.

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,046
So, I'm going to make some Greek Pasta Salad
today. This is a great thing

5
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:17,046
for all your summer time potlucks. Fathers
Day is coming up might be a

6
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:20,047
nice thing to take out for that and then after
we make the recipe, I'm

7
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:24,145
going to give you a tour of our new house
and tell you a little bit about

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:31,649
this watermelon that I ate.

9
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:39,067
The first thing for the pasta salad is we
need to cook some pasta and now,

10
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:46,076
one thing I've been meaning to talk to you
all about, I've got about a

11
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:49,167
quart of water almost to a boil here. You
really don't need to use like

12
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,067
six quarts of water when you're making pasta.
I wrote a big thing about

13
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,161
water conservation on my website. If you want
to go read some tips about

14
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,120
how to save water because it's our most precious
natural resource. I said

15
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:04,211
that sarcastically but I mean it so, anyway,
you need about a quart of

16
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,560
water to cook two cups of pasta or 1/2 a pound
which is what we're going to

17
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:08,152
do now.

18
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:13,281
The reason that people tell you to use a whole
sh** ton of water like that

19
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,835
is so that the pasta doesn't stick together
but as long as you're kind of

20
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,614
standing here for the first minute or so while
the pasta goes in and you

21
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:23,206
can kind of stir it around a little bit and
then it's not going to stick

22
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,210
together.

23
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:28,880
So I'm going to add some salt to my water.
So, you basically just want to

24
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:33,085
stir until it comes back to a boil which will
take 30 seconds to a minute

25
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,234
so you can put the lid back on for maybe 10
or 15 seconds to help it come

26
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,757
back to a boil faster but don't walk off because
it will boil over if you

27
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,051
do that. So, once it's boiling and you want
to set the timer. My pasta

28
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:46,310
package said 9 to 11 minutes. I'm going to
split the difference which is

29
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:51,190
ten and then subtract two, so I'm going to
set it for eight minutes. I did

30
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,533
it.

31
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,090
So, I've got my green beans while that's boiling,
I'm going to go ahead...

32
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,738
you want to snap the little stem ends off
these and I don't bother like

33
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:05,862
snapping off the little string ends because
I think they're kind of cute.

34
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:10,690
So, once you've got all your green beans snapped.
Just chop them all into

35
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:15,161
about one inch lengths. I'm going to set them
in this little bowl. Get

36
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,097
them the hell out of my way.

37
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:21,159
Once our time goes off which is just in about
two minutes, I'm going to add

38
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,084
the green beans and then let the pasta and
green beans boil together for

39
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:29,122
the last two minutes. That's going to sort
of blanch the green beans and

40
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,103
let the pasta finish cooking.

41
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,086
Then you just want to drain the pasta and
the green beans and give them a

42
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:36,181
quick rinse with some cold water You're not
really trying to cool them off

43
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,155
so much as you are trying to rinse off some
excess starch so that they

44
00:02:40,055 --> 00:02:42,064
don't stick together. We're just going to
leave those draining in the sink

45
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:47,079
while I get the other stuff prepped up so
I've got some fresh parsley.

46
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,173
I'm not going to be too anal about like not
leaving any stems behind. No

47
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:56,150
stem left behind. Just sort of pull off the
big leaves and we're going to

48
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:02,028
give it a rough chop. So, just sort of wad
it up into a little ball and

49
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:07,112
don't cut your fingers, and then I've got
some Kalamata olives and I've

50
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:11,111
already chopped up some sweet peppers and
some tomatoes here, as you can

51
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:16,012
see, You can buy presliced Kalamata olives
but I find that they get a

52
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:21,015
little bit mushy so I like to buy the ones
that are just pitted and whole

53
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:26,023
and then I'm just going to cut them in half.
Yeah, let's just cut them in

54
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:28,112
half. That's easier for everyone.

55
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:35,079
So then, we're going to work on the dressing
so that's going to require a

56
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,178
clove of garlic. Just get it minced up then
in a bowl here I'm going to

57
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:48,171
put this garlic. See if I can do this. This
is stupid. Ta-da. So I've

58
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:54,115
got my garlic in a large bowl, I'm going to
add olive oil. About two

59
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:58,099
tablespoons of that and then I'm going to
add some white wine vinegar.

60
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,163
You can use red wine vinegar. You can use
cider vinegar. So I'm going to

61
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:07,085
add a couple of tablespoons to this and traditional
vinaigrette is three

62
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:11,087
parts oil to one part acid like vinegar or
lemon juice. I like mine a

63
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:16,122
little bit more forceful. I like my vinaigrette
to really take control so

64
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:20,079
I'm going to do one to one ratio but feel
free to adjust it a little bit

65
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,081
according to your taste.

66
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:29,099
Get that kind of mixed up then some black
pepper of course and some salt

67
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:38,048
and the real kicker here, some oregano and
that's what makes it Greek. I'm

68
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:45,057
going to add a whole teaspoon. Get that mixed
up. Now let me go grab the

69
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:52,106
pasta, just dump that on in. I'm going to
use a wooden spoon so I don't

70
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:56,047
hurt you're delicate ears. Sweet viewers.

71
00:04:56,047 --> 00:05:03,047
So I toss this all around then we can add
our other vegetables and whatever

72
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:09,096
else you want to add to this. Cucumbers may
be good too. Red onion,

73
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:11,102
whatever. Have a pasta party.

74
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:16,005
So this is why too, when you're making pasta
for pasta salad you want to

75
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:20,100
undercook it just a tiny bit, take it off
the heat just moments before it

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,091
would be tender enough to serve hot because
then once you cool it off and

77
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:27,134
mix it with your vinaigrette it's going to
absorb some of that vinaigrette

78
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:32,039
and it makes it way delicious if it has some
room to absorb some of that.

79
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:36,086
Also, it would be really soggy if you cooked
it completely before you did

80
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:37,070
that.

81
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,085
So then once everything is mixed up together,
cooled off, then we're going

82
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,054
to add the last ingredient which you can totally
omit if you are a vegan or

83
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:47,153
you are some parmesan cheese instead too and
that's some crumbled feta

84
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,642
cheese. Just a little bit, couple of tablespoons
there we have it. We're

85
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:53,000
done.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,055
So, you could serve this right now at room
temperature or you could

87
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,130
refrigerate. It lasts in the fridge for couple
of days. Let me get a fork

88
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:05,152
because I'm going to eat it. So if you like
this recipe I also did a potato

89
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:11,120
salad last year so that's also really great.
I did coleslaw, like a

90
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,076
vinaigrette coleslaw that's also good because
it doesn't have mayonnaise so

91
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:16,765
like if it's sitting out in the sun, it's
not going to get all poisonous on

92
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,770
you, kill your children.

93
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:27,078
Da**it, that is good. Good as hell and I hope
you try it. Okay, than

94
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:29,134
there you go. Thank you so much for watching.

always at hilahcooking.com. But, hey, guess
what, remember what I told you?

96
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,808
House tour time. I'm going to take this pasta
and show you around the

97
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,790
house. Let's go.

98
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,178
Here's the kitchen pretty much saw that already.
Okay then after the

99
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:51,116
kitchen there is this sort of nook, we've
got our bar, some booze in it,

100
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:55,029
some random sh** that we haven't figured out
what to do with and then all

101
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:00,037
of my cookbook collection. You want to see
my favorite cookbook? It's

102
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:04,119
this one. It's the one I wrote. Okay, then
here's the living room. More

103
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,086
books, some other artwork we don't know what
to do with and then look.

104
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:13,086
World's largest dog bed.

105
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:16,090
The dogs really enjoy this couch. Chris and
I usually just end up sitting

106
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,040
on the floor because they are such space hogs.
Just kidding. We all cuddle

107
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,077
together and it's really cute.

108
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:29,143
Okay and here we went from about 1700 square
feet to about 1200 square feet

109
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:36,076
which is a way more manageable number, I think.
Bathroom, so we're selling

110
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,172
our old place and we're just renting this
place.

111
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:46,072
This is the baby room. Guess what, guys? I
lied, I did not eat a

112
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:54,600
watermelon. I'm having a baby because I had
sex. Okay, so having sex

113
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:59,030
makes you have a baby. So kids, listen up.
We're having a boy.

114
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:04,171
Fortunately, the room was already painted
this nice turquoise color and had

115
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:08,153
these window treatments that totally matched
our Pee Wee Herman poster.

116
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:14,057
Oh, also, the landlady left the crib for us.
So we were like, "Dude, free

117
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,063
crib." We have to get this place.

118
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:20,085
And, oh, prenatal yoga bolsters. We're going
to be doing so prenatal yoga

119
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:22,160
[inaudible 00:08:20] so keep an eye out for
that.

120
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:29,855
Okay, this is where the magic happens. This
is where the baby got made.

121
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,560
Not in this room but on this bed This is also
where Daisy can often be

122
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:40,595
found and this is why, got wooden floors and
we had to get rug over here so

123
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,820
that Daisy could get some traction so she
could jump up on the bed in the

124
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:49,082
morning and wake us up. She was just slipping
and sliding. It was so sad

125
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,107
and cute.

126
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:53,035
Okay, so let's go look at the back yard and
see if we can see the dogs

127
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:56,121
doing something cute. Look how big my butt's
getting. Guys. "Boom, boom,

128
00:08:57,021 --> 00:09:04,021
boom." Looks like a Godzilla butt. Well, that
rug is slippery. Be

129
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:11,152
careful. Oh yeah, so it's got a big old deck.
Hey guys and it came with a

130
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:19,052
swing set. Guys go be cute for the camera.
Go run around and play.

131
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:25,119
So yeah, basically, there's our new house.
We moved because we're having a

132
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:29,083
baby and I wanted a nicer neighborhood that
we could like walk around in so

133
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,176
this is really good. We're still in Austin
but its way more central and

134
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:35,094
there's like parks and little shops we can
walk to, so I don't have to load

135
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:39,131
up the car every time I want to take the baby
somewhere and it came with a

136
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:42,117
swing set and a crib. So how can we say, no.

137
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:48,113
Okay, that's it. New house new kitchen baby
