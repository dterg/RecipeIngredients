00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,150
Hilah: Hey dudes. I'm Hilah. Welcome to Hilah
Cooking. Today, I have a

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:06,554
very special guest who is the pizza expert
and he's going to

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,240
show you how to make homemade pizza at home.
All right, so

4
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:12,030
here's Brandon and him and his brother are
from Detroit.

5
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:12,136
Brandon: Yes.

6
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:18,085
Hilah: And you all just started a pizza trailer
called Via 313.

7
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:18,156
Brandon: Correct.

8
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:21,865
Hilah: Because 313 is Detroit's original area
code.

9
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:24,390
Brandon: That's so smart.

10
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,047
Hilah: Good. All right, so we're going to
make pizza today. You all

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,044
specialize in Detroit style, so tell me about
that.

12
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:42,044
Brandon: Well, Detroit style is made with
blue steel pans to make on a

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,030
Sicilian styled pie, but we put the sauce
on top, caramelized

14
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:51,532
cheese all the way around, and we get four
squares out of it.

15
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,170
Hilah: God, sounds yummy as hell.

16
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:53,109
Brandon: And it's so good.

17
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,048
Hilah: All right, but I don't have a pizza
pan. What do we do?

18
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:00,287
Brandon: We're just going to make it happen
with what we got in the

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,270
kitchen.

20
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,073
Hilah: Sweet! I love that. Awesome, let's
make some dough.

21
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:03,862
Brandon: All right.

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,670
Hilah: All right, so we got just a few ingredients
here. It's not like

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
it's that complicated it seems like.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,151
Brandon: It's pretty easy.

25
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,059
Hilah: Okay, cool. So you all do use bread
flour.

26
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:11,097
Brandon: Yes.

27
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:12,165
Hilah: That's the key thing, right?

28
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:16,142
Brandon: Yeah, a lot better than all-purpose
flour. Most people buy all-

29
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,139
purpose flour and you don't get the same rise
out of the dough.

30
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:23,085
Hilah: Okay. And then we've got some dry yeast.
Now is this what you

31
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:24,102
all use in . . .

32
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:30,017
Brandon: In the trailer we use active dry
yeast, but at home instant dry

33
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,032
yeast is a little bit better. It's a little
user friendly.

34
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:35,011
Hilah: Okay, all right. So this recipe is
a little modified from what

35
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,770
they actually do so that we can make homemade
pizza at home.

36
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:38,111
Brandon: Yes.

37
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,108
Hilah: All right. So I've got my stand mixer
here and I've got a bread

38
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:45,047
hook on this so we can use this for kneading.
If people don't

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:45,340
have that, they can't just knead it by hand
I guess.

40
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:45,103
Brandon: Yeah, be old school like that.

41
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:45,460
Hilah: Where did I get muscles?

42
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:45,065
Brandon: Yeah.

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:45,522
Hilah: So we're just going to put all this
stuff in and turn on the

44
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:46,020
thingy.

45
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:46,531
Brandon: Yeah, that's pretty easy.

46
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:46,750
Hilah: Cool. So we got our yeast and we're
going to put it in with the

47
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:46,099
flour. Stop me when I hook up.

48
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:46,128
Brandon: I'll slap the shit out of you.

49
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:47,056
Hilah: Okay, cool. Salt and sugar. And then
. . .

50
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:47,325
Brandon: So far.

51
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:47,912
Hilah: So far, so good.

52
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:48,664
Brandon: So far.

53
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,040
Hilah: Okay, cool. And then oil in there too?

54
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:50,070
Brandon: Yeah, did all right so far.

55
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,246
Hilah: Thanks professor. Okay, and then I'm
going to put this in here.

56
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,220
Okay, and then what is it?

57
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:53,028
Brandon: Yeah.

58
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:54,561
Hilah: And turn this on?

59
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:55,900
Brandon: Yes.

60
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,017
Hilah: Okay, so this . . . Well, now it'll
just go and it'll start to

61
00:01:58,007 --> 00:01:58,065
kind of like . . .

62
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:04,827
Brandon: Yeah, it'll start to ball up and
you'll be able to tell once it

63
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,111
becomes one . . .

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,431
Hilah: Okay.

65
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:18,719
Brandon: . . . etc. It's very loose right
now obviously.

66
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:26,173
Hilah: All right. So we'll just let it go
for a few minutes and then

67
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:33,749
we'll come back and take a look at it.

68
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:51,779
Brandon: Yeah, I would say five to six minutes
is pretty standard.

69
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,664
Hilah: Okay. Yeah, it's already changing,
cool. Okay. So it's been

70
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,180
like five minutes or something.

71
00:03:09,018 --> 00:03:09,407
Brandon: Yeah.

72
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:09,646
Hilah: Look at that.

73
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,404
Brandon: Yeah, it should be nice on the hands.
It shouldn't stick to

74
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,036
your fingers too bad. If it does, just throw
some more flour in

75
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:15,461
there.

76
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,900
Hilah: Yeah, we added maybe a couple extra
teaspoons I guess.

77
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,108
Brandon: Yeah, just make it easy to handle
for yourself.

78
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,070
Hilah: Okay. Now we've got some flour on our
bitch as they call it in

79
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:24,740
the restaurant.

80
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,090
Brandon: Yes, bitch flour. Yes, that's the
fancy words for it.

81
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:28,767
Hilah: It's just flour on the counter top.

82
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,208
Brandon: This recipe should make enough for
five or six pizzas.

83
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:32,173
Hilah: Okay.

84
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,903
Brandon: You can cut it.

85
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,483
Hilah: Okay.

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,551
Brandon: Yeah, and [inaudible 00:03:36].

87
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,896
Hilah: Pizza party! So I'll do six.

88
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:40,790
Brandon: Make it four.

89
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,558
Hilah: Make it four, okay.

90
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,344
Brandon: So it'll be a little bit thicker.

91
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,020
Hilah: Okay. Wow, it cuts really nice.

92
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,071
Brandon: Yeah, it's got a nice feel to it.

93
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:52,525
Hilah: And then what do you just kind of . . .

94
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,224
Brandon: Well, you can ball it like this.
Pull it over like that. You

95
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,398
pull the sides and I'll pinch it at the bottom,
and then make

96
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:03,841
sure you cap it like that. That's what they
call it.

97
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:04,741
Hilah: Kind of like pinch it.

98
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:06,475
Brandon: Yeah, and then the other nice restaurant
ball.

99
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:07,271
Hilah: Ooh! Cutsie tootsie.

100
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,010
Brandon: You do another one. I'll do another
one.

101
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,001
Hilah: Okay.

102
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,760
Brandon: I think yours actually looks nicer
than mine.

103
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,180
Hilah: I'm a girl.

104
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,137
Brandon: That's what happens.

105
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,380
Hilah: So then we'll put these in the fridge
and that's an important

106
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,118
thing that you all make sure to let it kind
of rest over time.

107
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:27,028
Brandon: Yeah, I like to give it a good 12
or 24 hours to rest, gives it

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,292
a nice flavor.

109
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,133
Hilah: Okay, cool, so start this a day ahead
people.

110
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,210
Brandon: Yes, plan ahead.

111
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,096
Hilah: Okay. Well, this one's not quite as
pretty. Let's use this one.

112
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:34,168
It's the prettiest.

113
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,207
Brandon: Yeah, thank you. I did that.

114
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,907
Hilah: I noticed. And then I'll just kind
of, I guess, a little oil in

115
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:40,721
here.

116
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,470
Brandon: Yeah, throw a little oil in there
so it doesn't still too bad

117
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:46,146
and it'll be easier to handle tomorrow. It
won't . . .

118
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:47,255
Hilah: Stick to the . . .

119
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:47,780
Brandon: Yeah.

120
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,162
Hilah: Okay. And keep it from getting like
a dry out skin here.

121
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,761
Brandon: Yeah, obviously covering it so it
won't dry out too bad, but

122
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,360
Hilah: All right. So then we'll put this in
the fridge and then I'll

123
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,490
get you back here tomorrow.

124
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:57,125
Brandon: I'll meet you tomorrow.

125
00:04:58,025 --> 00:04:59,031
Hilah: Okay, cool.

126
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,790
Brandon: Maybe, I don't know.

127
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:05,300
Hilah: Well, if you're not drunk. Okay, so
here we are again. Nice

128
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:05,028
outfit.

129
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:05,128
Brandon: Thank you.

130
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:09,887
Hilah: He did not spend the night here.

131
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,144
Brandon: Yeah.

132
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,180
Hilah: Okay. So we got our raised doughs.

133
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:17,112
Brandon: Yeah, and what you want to do is
kind of make love to it. Don't

134
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:23,091
go in there and bang it all out. Just the
more you mess it up

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,271
the harder it'll be.

136
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,360
Hilah: Am I messing it up?

137
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:25,995
Brandon: You're destroying it.

138
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,375
Hilah: Oh, God. I am. I'm sorry.

139
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:28,800
Brandon: There you go.

140
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:31,877
Hilah: Okay. Because we don't want to like
bust all the air out,

141
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:32,693
right?

142
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,985
Brandon: No, well again, the easier it is
to handle right here.

143
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,050
Hilah: Okay.

144
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:40,074
Brandon: So what you want to do is make a
little crust. So imagine a

145
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:40,903
pizza on your table.

146
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:41,780
Hilah: Okay.

147
00:05:41,078 --> 00:05:41,707
Brandon: Come on, get with it.

148
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,770
Hilah: Okay. I was going to watch. I don't
make it.

149
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,152
Brandon: No, make a little crust.

150
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:47,511
Hilah: Okay. Flip it over.

151
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:48,560
Brandon: Yeah.

152
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,059
Hilah: And then . . .

153
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,081
Brandon: Keep doing it.

154
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,093
Hilah: Okay.

155
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:58,582
Brandon: Now, flip it over again. All right.
You can push out the gas in

156
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,452
the middle, but don't mess up the crust that
you started.

157
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:07,530
Hilah: Okay. Yours looks better than mine.

158
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:11,053
Brandon: Now use your knuckles to stretch
it. Just pull it apart and

159
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:12,130
then you can [inaudible 00:06:10] . . .

160
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:13,075
Hilah: Oh!

161
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:15,008
Brandon: Ah, geez!

162
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,147
Hilah: Party foul. Pizza party foul.

163
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,060
Brandon: Yes, you can stretch it about [inaudible
00:06:20] apart like

164
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:22,058
that. Put your hand back and stretch it. Put
your hand back,

165
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:27,061
just pull it apart with your knuckles like
that. There you go.

166
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:31,065
That ain't going to tear on you.

167
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:33,734
Hilah: Okay. This pretty cool.

168
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,326
Brandon: Yeah, I think this is the most intimidating
part that people

169
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,610
get a little freaked out about making pizza.
And if it does tear

170
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:44,650
on you, just pinch it together and there you
go.

171
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:45,245
Hilah: Okay. Just patch it?

172
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,110
Brandon: Yeah, just patch it together.

173
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,030
Hilah: You did that on purpose . . .

174
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:47,214
Brandon: I did that on . . .

175
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:49,580
Hilah: . . . to show us how to fix it.

176
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:49,477
Brandon: Yeah, exactly.

177
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:50,027
Hilah: Okay.

178
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,120
Brandon: That's what I tell people.

179
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:51,040
Hilah: Cool.

180
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:53,050
Brandon: Keep stretching with your knuckles
until you get about a 12

181
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,087
inch pie. I think yours is pretty good actually.

182
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,100
Hilah: Yeah, it's not [inaudible 00:06:56]
round.

183
00:06:57,036 --> 00:07:00,145
Brandon: Let's destroy it, so we can be done
with it.

184
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:01,476
Hilah: It's the pizza expert, okay?

185
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:05,650
Brandon: Yeah, I'm done with it and so that's
good.

186
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:06,584
Hilah: Okay. We just don't need one anyway.

187
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:08,310
Brandon: That's good, yeah.

188
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,105
Hilah: Okay.

189
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:12,083
Brandon: Because I'm not hungry. All right.
We can use that.

190
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,105
Hilah: Okay. So now we put some toppings on.

191
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,924
Brandon: Yeah, so let's go ahead and put a
little flour on this. Most

192
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:19,061
people don't have these at home.

193
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:20,300
Hilah: Right.

194
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:25,272
Brandon: You can use just a cardboard box
and throw a little flour on

195
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,370
the cart. I'm not hungry.

196
00:07:27,037 --> 00:07:34,037
Brandon: Geez! A fucking shit show over here.
So no matter what you do

197
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:37,156
it's going to lose its shape and form. So
once you get it on

198
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,099
your cardboard box or if you're fancy and
have a [inaudible

199
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,112
00:07:40] at home just pull it back out and
restructure it to a

200
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:48,841
nice round size. I won't keep saying pie because
most people

201
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:50,971
here in Texas don't call it a pie.

202
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:51,650
Hilah: Right. Yankee.

203
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:51,161
Brandon: There it is.

204
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:53,240
Hilah: Just kidding. Welcome Yankee.

205
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,832
Brandon: I don't have ten years underneath
from some [inaudible

206
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:56,710
00:07:57] Yankee.

207
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:56,800
Hilah: Okay. Wow!

208
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,520
Brandon: That's a good start right there.

209
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,111
Hilah: That looks awesome.

210
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:01,090
Brandon: Yeah.

211
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,578
Hilah: Okay. So we'll get some sauce and cheeses.

212
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:06,511
Brandon: Yeah, I don't know where it's at.

213
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:07,430
Hilah: Oh, you know what? I made sauce.

214
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:09,992
Brandon: Where is it? There it is. It's a
little easier if you put it in

215
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:10,408
the center.

216
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:11,270
Hilah: Okay.

217
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:15,016
Brandon: I put a pretty good mound in the
center all the time and just

218
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,353
kind of swirl it out into the crust. You should
be able to see

219
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,120
where your crust was.

220
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,051
Hilah: And I can see it on mine, yeah.

221
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,168
Brandon: Yeah, a little bit. If you have an
imagination just make it

222
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:28,094
happen.

223
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,580
Hilah: So we don't want to like saturate it.

224
00:08:31,058 --> 00:08:34,207
Brandon: No, just give it a good . . . And
sometimes it's better to put

225
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,560
a little bit up at the top because it'll all
kind of bleed

226
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,455
through the center once it starts baking.

227
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:39,054
Hilah: Oh, okay. A little heavier on the edges.

228
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,985
Brandon: So I like to put a little . . . Yeah,
a little heavier on the

229
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,754
edges especially because the crust tends to
dry out a little

230
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:45,537
bit.

231
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:46,040
Hilah: Okay.

232
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,037
Brandon: And then just let it kind of bleed
through, through the center.

233
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:48,626
Hilah: Cool.

234
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,800
Brandon: So that's the beautiful saucing.

235
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:55,039
Hilah: Awesome. And then the cheesing happens
next.

236
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:56,240
Brandon: Yeah.

237
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:56,347
Hilah: All right. We got our moz.

238
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:57,208
Brandon: Yeah, we'll do it together.

239
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,060
Hilah: Okay.

240
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,094
Brandon: This is a whole milk mozzarella.
It bakes up a little bit

241
00:09:00,094 --> 00:09:03,094
nicer. It's got a little bit higher fat content
than like a

242
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:08,099
Kraft, a little moister cheese that you'd
get at . . . you know?

243
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,192
Hilah: Like pre-shredded kind of stuff.

244
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:14,117
Brandon: Yeah, if you want to be cheap. It's
like a buck more a pound,

245
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,063
but you'll taste the quality. It's already
got a nice salt

246
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:21,202
content so it'll pull the mozzarella flavor
out of it.

247
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,680
Hilah: Yum.

248
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,129
Brandon: Again, kind of the same with the
sauce. With the cheese you

249
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:26,074
want to put a little bit more around the edges.

250
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:26,793
Hilah: Okay.

251
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:32,680
Brandon: Not hit the crust, but let it kind
of bleed through. It'll all

252
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:35,141
melt towards the center. That's pretty good
right there.

253
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,050
Hilah: Cool. So we got our moz, now we get
our pepps.

254
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:38,047
Brandon: Yes.

255
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,130
Hilah: Cool. And this is some kind of . . .

256
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:43,092
Brandon: These are natural casing pepperonis.
This is what we use back

257
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:45,470
in Michigan and we're trying to bring a little
flavor back to

258
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:50,880
Texas from Detroit. These will shrink up,
cup and charr. We call

259
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,123
them grease cups back at home.

260
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:54,025
Hilah: Mm! I love that kind.

261
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:57,041
Brandon: Yes, but you don't find it around
here too much though.

262
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,066
Hilah: Cool.

263
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:00,119
Brandon: Just whatever you want to do.

264
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,658
Hilah: Just get it on there.

265
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:03,910
Brandon: Who cares?

266
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:03,163
Hilah: Jesus.

267
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,125
Brandon: Whatever. There it is.

268
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,614
Hilah: Show is over.

269
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,883
Brandon: Here. Just put some so it's not on
the crust though. But for

270
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,470
real, these will melt, cook up nice, so whatever.
It doesn't

271
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,069
have to be pretty because they'll do their
own thing.

272
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:17,150
Hilah: All right. Let's put it in the oven.

273
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:22,654
Brandon: That's beautiful. So again, we're
using our fancy peel from the

274
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:28,690
restaurant or the trailer. We have a stone
in here. It's

275
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,143
preheated about 550 degrees. If you give it
a good shake, again,

276
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:34,252
if you're using a pizza box at home, you could
use a little bit

277
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,550
of flour on the box and just kind of give
it a good shaking on

278
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,150
there, make love to it, and let it do its
thing. It should take

279
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:46,404
about ten minutes and it should be ready to
go.

280
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,180
Hilah: Okay, cool. If people don't have a
pizza stone, what can they

281
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:50,367
use?

282
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,480
Brandon: A pizza stone, you can use just a
regular aluminum sheet pan.

283
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:57,067
This cooks up real nicely. You'll get a nice
crisp on the bottom

284
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:01,135
or as you said we could use a cast-iron upside
down, make a mini

285
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,384
personal pie.

286
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:04,570
Hilah: A smaller one.

287
00:11:04,057 --> 00:11:04,068
Brandon: Yeah.

288
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:04,079
Hilah: Cool.

289
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,094
Brandon: But stone works the best. They're
only about 15 bucks.

290
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:06,137
Hilah: Awesome.

291
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:10,926
Brandon: And a local art shop.

292
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,820
Hilah: Voila! Awesome. Okay.

293
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:22,082
Brandon: Now you're cutting it now so go ahead.

294
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:26,118
Hilah: I have to cut it?

295
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:27,067
Brandon: Yeah, cut it in eighths, cut it in
half.

296
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:27,156
Hilah: Okay.

297
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:27,761
Brandon: Just, you know . . .

298
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:28,250
Hilah: My girl muscles are tiny.

299
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:33,042
Brandon: Put those mashed potatoes into it.
Don't do that. All right.

300
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:33,331
This is sad.

301
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,230
Brandon: Forget it. So we'll cut it in half.

302
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:35,042
Hilah: Let's have a man do it.

303
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:35,381

Brandon: I can't guarantee you get a . . .

306
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,011
Hilah: So not like back and forth and sawing
it.

307
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,776
Brandon: No, don't do that because you'll
have 18 different pieces out

308
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:49,630
of that.

309

Hilah: Yay! Mm.

314
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,105
Brandon: Everything is good except for the
sauce. I don't know what

315
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:58,063
happened.

316
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:03,832
Hilah: Oh, my God. My mom did it. That was
weird.

317
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,980
Brandon: I don't really know what happened
with the sauce, but the

318
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:08,173
cheese, the pepperoni, the crust, perfect.

00:12:09,073 --> 00:12:10,155
Hilah: Dude! This is awesome.
