as I can protest so I'm gonna update my

14
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:45,093
flaw a little bit at that time

15
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:48,134
green cabbage their shine it up some
white onions diced

16
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:52,050
and sound had come a so this is the
route

17
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:55,064
its kinda starches kinda a me the
texture

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,652
Robert 80 but its sweet County cap on
cam I'll

19
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,850
sup at add a nice

20
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:06,120
little play dirty a slot am that that an
hour

21
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:11,201
starting out for and then and since I'll
super duper simple

22
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,413
pasta recipe hour in a news assault

23
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,561
and lime juice to get it softened up to
get that

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,990
cabbage can releasing some water and

25
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,228
get nice and tender so either rock

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,170
runs on this raw diet thing but you know

27
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:33,136
some Robert smalls obviously are good
for you like salad

28
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,860
like celery sticks might care its TX

29
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:40,935
okay so that's about a teaspoon salt get
that cat tossed around

30
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:45,750
homes your ha sometimes out you can use
your hands also

31
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,660
nature's tongs use a bigger ball and I
didn't see you don't have to worry about

32
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:51,109
it

33
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,518
full of out everywhere case assaults

34
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,630
coating everything are going to squeeze
in some lime juice

35
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:02,131
an FU are be stricken

36
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,820
by Harley high land prices you can use a
lemon juice

37
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,640
just don't tell anyone really expected
margins from now I'm since I paid

38
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:16,095
33 cents for it hopefully

39
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,153
that close to took a last chance get
that tossed around

40
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:23,137
toss that salad okay and then an awsome

41
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:27,042
lamp or fresh coriander

42
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:31,091
a few are British and I don't bother

43
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,106
pulling off the stems first launcher I
just

44
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:38,650
chop it up really really find is a lot
of labor in the stands actually

45
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:42,123
so you can see why don't you can see but
I can see with my life by

46
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,115
at the cabin has already started to
soften up just that little bit and

47
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:49,034
motion in the ocean summers gonna set
this aside and work on some

48
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,035
other staff and just leave it at room
temperature and how she looks like when

49
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:52,112
we're done

50
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:56,069
your BM a test oh my god to be like wow

51

as I can and day and got Sam

52
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:05,053

53
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:09,082
minced chocolate wrappers so to pull a
intentarlo

54
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:14,099
they can animal can it's like a dollar
and if the ins and overstock that's

55
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,130
kinda sweetie and

56
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:19,038
slightly then agree that mostly sweet
and hot

57
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,107
they're smoked jalapeno peppers in an
airport in this

58
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,008
do it fast so whenever I get ajar home

59
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:29,100
I like to transfer and milk and how much
transfer into a jarring keep in the

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,077
fridge in are still intact for

61
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,124
so they're pretty spicy

62
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:39,061
nice start with have one and just

63
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:43,064
men sit up and that pretty much just
turned into a paste as you meant sing at

64
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:47,148
you know a and risk and holler access
pass a

65
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:52,071
all messed up it's about table stand
chipotle in adobo

66
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:56,080
plot that innocent man is lick your
finger

67
00:03:56,008 --> 00:04:00,277
cuz who cares I'm like cooking for
myself and this guy doesn't give a shit

68
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,130
okay mad them engines

69
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:08,058
so many tables women that synth Sol

70
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,065
and a man at a little bit a malt vinegar

71
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:14,136
which is really really good on fried
fish an

72
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:18,185
are now

73
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,660
klansmen agreements can have ninety in

74
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:24,153
sweet anyway if you can't find this then
you can use at smile and use its

75
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:27,032
scalable tartness but also

76
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,970
kinda nice cuz the whole fish connection

77
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:33,136
then we're going to mix this up so the

78
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:38,180
sourness and that an internal and you
should balance out the heat and it's

79
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:38,116
appalling pretty well

80
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:42,058
but if it's still a little bit too spicy
for you know I would recommend that you

81
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:43,617
had a little bit of honey or sugar

82
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,720
and to sorta temper that heat a little
bit but

83
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:53,081
those tests pretty good to me comes up

84
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:57,116
though on the set aside and start
working on the fish so I have changed

85
00:04:58,016 --> 00:04:59,080
anything from the original recipe

86
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:03,013
as far as the seasonings and spices and
putting on it so

87
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:07,121
the two main things here our son human
seeds and sound an ass

88
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,023
this is not star anise just aniseed

89
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:14,040
and its kinda liquor she finally flavor

90
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:16,076
if you can't find that you can leave it
out but it does get really really nicely

91
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:17,059
with this

92
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,063
finance a whole came and seen said those
here

93
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:23,132
and Sam chili powder and when I sichuan
patter

94
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,084

95
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:30,088
enter chile's ground at New Mexico Chile
I don't mean

96
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:33,152
like commercial brand Chile para has

97
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,093
garlic salt in our stuff mixed into
other that's what you can find and

98
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:38,098
that's what you have in your pantry that
AZT

99
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:42,044
holy totally fine please re-up

100
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:47,106
tomato mourner and pesto you can use pre
ground spices if you want that

101
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:51,010
you know me Alex me things harmonies of

102

and salt and pepper

106
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,380
cuz to what's life without salt and
pepper

107
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,103
you wouldn't have that song push it for
one thing

108
00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:18,096
next I'll okay now for that reading
reading

109
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:21,099
heart reading writing weirdo

110
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:25,133
I'm just using some corn you know if you
are in another country

111
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:29,087
not the best country in the world
America

112
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:32,112
can inked I

113
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:36,016
if you are in another country and you
don't have crime you know anything is

114
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,022
fine plant

115
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:41,100
basically the same thing that would add
this too thats

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,229
an extra renowned it combined

117
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,120
now all we're going to the fish I did
the fish last so that I don't have to

118
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:49,111
wash my cutting board

119
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:53,084
between acting like a rock fish jus

120
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:56,157
on things she mmm

121
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:00,057
I'm using them while snapper

122
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:03,153
but you is pretty much any like light
ish fishermen you probably could use

123
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,144
salmon or something like that here

124
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:09,050
field catfish like and I asked that

125
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:13,032
fishmonger if you would scan it for me
so

126
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:17,069
these are skinless and boneless so I'm
just gonna cut them into pieces

127
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,071
maybe an inch wide by however long it is

128
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:24,119
so that usually ends up being about the
race has to go into attack a

129
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,055
sheer fish channa you're just gonna toss
around

130
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:33,099
and this cornmeal mixture just to cut it
we don't really need anything

131
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,116
to help here the crime you understand
moisture from the fish

132
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:41,245
well keep it on their moist sheesh

133
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,360
and you can do this fish coating part
had it I'm goin discover I'm leaving the

134
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:45,124
French

135
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:49,038
and after a couple hours and that'll
help that coating

136
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,041
stick on better to him you can leave
them set for a while

137
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:57,119
okay so officials are coded was gonna
but it's it here

138
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,110
in my little dash for just as long it
takes to heat up a skillet with some oil

139
00:08:03,001 --> 00:08:05,068
in it and then we'll get to fry and the
fish

140
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:08,168
fish wrap I day I C one here can have

141
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,077
over comedienne I medium-high heat

142
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:18,082
and then and me 2 tablespoons a canola
oil or corn oil peanut oil something

143
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:20,074
kinda neutral

144
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:25,063
the high smoke point

145
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,807
so while around like a lava lamp

146
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,690
down behind get distracted and then you
want to cook your fish

147
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:37,137
in two matches cut the smaller pieces
with the smaller pieces in the bigger on

148
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,456
Saturday Iran's

149
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,805
and when you land in the hot oil Kali it
away from you just in case

150
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:47,951
see you know splatter heil on your

151
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,243
beautiful face Jesus

152
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,130
we sell there so therefore we just take

153
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:59,054
two to three minutes on each side I S
with speaker foley's like

154
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:03,063
the snapper you might need to do more
than just to size

155
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,882
go ahead and get side

156
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:10,542
of
