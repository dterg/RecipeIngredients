00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,833
Okay, so today I'm here
with Maureen and Bria--my client

2
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:25,417
Maureen and her
daughter, she's 10 years old.

3
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:26,708
Maureen is 38.

4
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,500
And so we're gonna be doing
kale chips, cacao kale chips.

5
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:34,088
This was my little phenomenal
recipe that I developed.

6
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:38,917
They're just grabbing two
bunches of kale chips--raw,

7
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,542
organic kale.

8
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:44,083
And taking off the
leafs, putting it in here.

9
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,917
So I'm gonna let
them work away at that.

10
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,922
So kale is a super food.

11
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,125
You know, people always
ask, "What's a super food?"

12
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,417
There isn't one super food,
but this is definitely a very

13
00:00:52,417 --> 00:00:55,750
nutritious food, and it's
got a lot of phytonutrients,

14
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,658
disease-fighting properties,
which is what we want.

15
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,358
So cacao kale chips, again,
two bunches of kale, you've got

16
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,958
coconut oil.

17
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:04,963
And again, another
oil of your choice.

18
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,750
You can do, even, an
almond oil if you want.

19
00:01:07,075 --> 00:01:09,242
I have almond meal, as well.

20
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:13,375
Then I have some stevia and
organic cacao powder that we're

21
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,750
gonna be mixing in.

22
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:17,033
So with kale chips, a lot of
times I see people on social

23
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,583
media posting, you know, that
they put them in their oven, put

24
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:21,792
them at 350.

25
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,458
That is a choice for you, you
can do that for about 10 or 15

26
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,458
minutes.

27
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,533
However, I'm gonna tell you
the importance of why getting a

28
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,500
dehydrator is actually
gonna help with getting those

29
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:32,130
nutrients in.

30
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,700
So I have my Excalibur with
me, which Santa brought to me 2

31
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,500
years ago.

32
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:37,030
And thankful for that.

33
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:40,200
The importance of a dehydrator
is it doesn't kill the enzymes.

34
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,292
And the enzymes are so important
because it keeps the nutrients

35
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,667
alive.

36
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,958
The whole reason we're eating
vegetables is because of the

37
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,917
powerhouse foods that they are.

38
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:51,992
So when you're cooking them
above a certain level, you're

39
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,833
actually killing
all the nutrients.

40
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,908
So again, I'm 40 years old, I
didn't have all these tools when

41
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,658
I was in my 20s or 30s, so it's,
you know, over time I've made an

42
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,958
investment in certain pieces
of equipment that have actually

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,958
helped my kitchen and the
foods I eat work better for me.

44
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,333
So, Maureen, how do you
incorporate kale for your

45
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,208
family?

46
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,833
Well, for Bria I put it on
her sandwich for school for her

47
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,838
lunch.

48
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:22,500
And at home, just for dinner
instead of lettuce, or I even

49
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:26,838
mix it with other types of
lettuce, spinach or mustard

50
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,917
greens.

51
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:32,292
And we can have it in a salad,
we can have it with turkey

52
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:35,375
burger, chicken.

53
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,292
That sounds good.

54
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,208
I'm gonna have to get
some recipes from you.

55
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,208
Okay, so Bria, do you like kale.

56
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,125
Yeah.

57
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,208
You don't, like, throw it
in the garbage 'cause you're at

58
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,375
school and Mom can't see
that you're not eating it?

59
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,417
No, I eat it in my sandwich.

60
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,625
Very good, very good.

61
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,333
So there you have it, a great
way to get kale in for your kids

62
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,208
to enjoy it.

63
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,167
So let's go ahead, if you wanna
go ahead and grab the other

64
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:02,192
ingredients here.

65
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:07,458
Let's get the
almond meal in here.

66
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,375
I'm gonna help these guys while
they're going ahead and getting

67
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,500
off all the leafs.

68
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:14,080
So again, I'm putting in a
couple tablespoons here.

69
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,100
So, like I said, measuring
great, but overtime, you know,

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,875
an extra tablespoon or 2,
it's not gonna hurt you.

71
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:27,458
You wanna put some stevia?

72
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,125
Go ahead and sprinkle that in.

73
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,583
So again, some stevia to taste.

74
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,875
And then I've got
the cacao powder.

75
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:41,833
So again, if you love
chocolate, it's great.

76
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,167
And then I'm gonna go
ahead and pour the oil in.

77
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:50,333
Again, you can measure and do a
couple tablespoons, but again I

78
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,338
want all that powder to stick.

79
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:58,250
Three people making kale chips.

80
00:03:58,025 --> 00:04:02,483
This is a good
workout for the arms.

81
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:09,125
Okay.

82
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,083
We good?

83
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,875
Awesome.

84
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,208
So here, I love these mixing
bowls, they're my favorite.

85
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,667
Okay, who wants to shake it up?

86
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:20,333
You're the dancing
queen, let's go.

87
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,500
Shake it up.

88
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,630
There we go!

89
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,208
Fun in the kitchen
with Bria and Maureen.

90
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,833
So, when they're done, you're
gonna see, like I said, you can

91
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,208
put 'em in the oven.

92
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:33,250
And I'm gonna have
you scoot forward here.

93
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:36,858
So why don't you go ahead,
open that up, let them see.

94
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,667
So this is how they look.

95
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,375
And you can kind of mix
it up a little bit more.

96
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,917
But when they're done,
they're nice and crispy.

97
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:49,942
And a crunch--they're so good.

98
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,500
So good.

99
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,080
Go ahead, grab one.

100
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,858
Delicious.

101
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,375
So thanks for joining us
on "Nicole's Healthy Minutes."
