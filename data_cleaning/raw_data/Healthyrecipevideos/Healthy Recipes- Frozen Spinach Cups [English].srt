I'm Natalie Hodson here in
the bodybuilding.com kitchen

2
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,015
showing you how to
make Frozen Spinach Cups.

3
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,012
This is a really easy--more
of a tip than a recipe.

4
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,669
I use this to thicken up my
protein shakes, and it's great

5
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,733
because when you put it in a
protein shake, you really can't

6
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:26,734
even taste it.

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:29,300
Now it does turn your protein
shakes green so if you have an

8
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,436
issue with the color of your
protein shake then you can add a

9
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,200
few blueberries to it and it
turns it purple and then you

10
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,369
don't see the green color.

11
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,033
Spinach is a green, dark
green leafy vegetable

12
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:39,900
which is really good.

13
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,576
It's high in vitamin A and it is
really high in iron and calcium

14
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:44,468
as well.

15
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,575
So for the ingredients we're
gonna use today, we're gonna use

16
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:50,369
spinach and usually I buy
between a 6 to an 8 ounce bag.

17
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,900
Different brands have different
sizes that they sell but just

18
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,242
one bag of spinach.

19
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,134
And then water.

20
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:59,233
And here I have 2 cups of water.

21
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,600
And we might not use the full
2 cups.

22
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,006
What we're gonna do is add the
spinach and slowly add the water

23
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:07,009
until it's the
consistency that we need.

24
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,042
And then you're gonna need a
blender, and then we're gonna

25
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,800
use a muffin tin pan as well.

26
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:13,012
And what we're gonna do is once
we blend everything together,

27
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,269
we're gonna pour the liquid
into the muffin tin pan and then

28
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,100
freeze it that way.

29
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,009
Okay, so this recipe
is really simple.

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,013
All you do is you put
your spinach in the blender.

31
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:29,670
And I just take
handfuls and put it in.

32
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:34,073
And you're gonna start by
filling it about almost all the

33
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,669
way full.

34
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:37,875
My rule of thumb
is about 1/2 cup of water

35
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:45,500
per 2 handfuls of spinach so I
just kinda pour the water in.

36
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,036
There it looks like we used
about 1 cup so we'll start with

37
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,600
that and then slowly
add water as we need to.

38
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:54,073
And then you just put
the lid on your blender.

39
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,600
It's gonna be kinda loud.

40
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:03,008
Alright.

41
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:08,675
So as you can see, it really
blends down quite a bit, and so

42
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:12,471
what I'm gonna do is
actually add some more spinach.

43
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:20,467
And so we're gonna add the
rest of our spinach in here.

44
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,033
And then we're just
gonna keep blending it.

45
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,967
I don't think I need to add more
water, but I'm just gonna kinda

46
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:25,633
blend it.

47
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,641
If it gets too thick--you
basically want it just like a

48
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:31,100
liquid consistency,
maybe a little bit thicker.

49
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,568
Not quite as thick as a
milkshake consistency.

50
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:51,341
Alright.
I think this looks pretty good.

51
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,367
Basically you just want it
ground fine enough so you don't

52
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:57,833
have big chunks of spinach.

53
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,835
And then what I do is I take
this, and I just pour it right

54
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,042
into my muffin tin.

55
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,935
And I usually fill these
pretty much all the way full

56
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:12,139
because what I do is, and I'll
show you later, is I just use

57
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:16,867
one in each of my
protein shakes.

58
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:17,639
Alright.

59
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:21,100
So it looks like
this made about six.

60
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,268
And so we could double this if
we wanted and make 12 and freeze

61
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,400
all 12, but today I think
we're just gonna make all 6.

62
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,007
I'm gonna stick this in the
freezer and then just let it

63
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,174
freeze for about 3 hours.

64
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,872
You can even leave it in there
for longer if you aren't home

65
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,371
after 3 hours.

66
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:35,776
And then we're gonna pop
these out and put them in Ziploc

67
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,833
baggies to keep them in the
freezer to use for our protein

68
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,400
shakes later in the week.

69
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,436
So I just took these
spinach cups out of the freezer.

70
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,733
They've been in the freezer for
about 3 hours, and as you

71
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,300
can tell, they're rock solid so
you can do one of two things.

72
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:05,370
You can just let them sit on the
counter for a few minutes until

73
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,800
they're melted a little bit and
you can pop them out or what I

74
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:10,008
like to do--it's a little bit
faster--is I'm just gonna run

75
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:13,641
the bottom of the pan
underneath some hot water.

76
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:31,367
Alright.
That should do the trick.

77
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:35,900
And then what I like to do
is just take a butter knife.

78
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,342
And obviously we're not gonna
use all six of these spinach

79
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:42,236
cups in a protein shake at once,
and so I just take Ziploc bags

80
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,540
and I put usually three or four
of the spinach cups in a Ziploc

81
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,200
bag and I put
them in the freezer.

82
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,935
So that way later when I go to
make a protein shake, I can just

83
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,567
grab one out.

84
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,576
I also use these when I make
smoothies, fruit smoothies for

85
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,471
my 2-year old.

86
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,100
It's one of the few ways I
can get him to eat vegetables.

87
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,239
So I'm just gonna pop
the spinach cup out.

88
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,840
That's what it looks like.

89
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:08,767
And just gonna go ahead--it's a
little bit messy, but you can

90
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,900
just rinse your
hands when you're done.

91
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,015
So I'll probably
do three in a bag.

92
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,738
Sometimes I try to fit too many
in there and I can't get it to

93
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,667
zip.

94
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,900
Oops.

95
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:44,400
I'm gonna just put two in this
bag and we're gonna save one to

96
00:05:44,004 --> 00:05:46,337
use in a protein shake today.

97
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,741
To make the protein shake, I
like to use unsweetened almond

98
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:50,400
milk.

99
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:51,271
I like to use the
kind with vanilla.

100
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:54,933
Just make sure you get the one
that has 35 or 40 calories, and

101
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:57,935
read the ingredient list because
some of the almond milks do add

102
00:05:58,133 --> 00:06:00,135
sugar, and you wanna make
sure it's the unsweetened kind

103
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,600
without any sugar.

104
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,839
But if you don't have almond
milk, you could also use water

105
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:06,467
or regular milk.

106
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,733
I usually use
about 8 ounces or so.

107
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:13,167
I just kind of eyeball it.

108
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:16,169
And then I'm gonna do
one scoop of whey protein.

109
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:22,376
You can use these spinach cups
with any flavor, any brand.

110
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:27,200
And then instead of ice, I'm
gonna use my frozen spinach cup.

111
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:30,003
And then what it's gonna do is
it's gonna thicken up the shake

112
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:35,036
and also add some good vitamins:
vitamin A, calcium, and iron.

113
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:40,072
Just gonna blend it up.

114
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:03,367
Alright.
That looks pretty good.

115
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:06,367
And then I'm just
gonna pour it into my cup.

116
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,967
So it does turn the shake a
green color, and if that kinda

117
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,700
weirds you out, you can add some
blueberries to this and then it

118
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,007
turns it purple.

119
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,011
And actually my son won't drink
them if they're green, but if I

120
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:20,006
add some blueberries and it
turns them purple, then he has

121
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:26,739
no clue and he drinks them just
fine so--tastes like a protein

122
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:27,339
shake.

123
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,867
You can't even taste
the spinach at all.

124
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:34,233
