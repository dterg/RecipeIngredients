00:00:18,233 --> 00:00:18,239
Hi.

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,838
I'm Jamie Eason, and today I'm
in the bodybuilding.com kitchen,

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,700
and I'm gonna make my
Italian Turkey Zucchini Burgers.

4
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:28,011
I've already started by prepping
my oven and setting it on broil.

5
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,568
You wanna set it on high.
There's high and low settings.

6
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:34,133
Make sure you put it on high,
and I've moved the rack to the

7
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:38,200
top about 2 inches
from the heating element.

8
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,240
I've also already
grated my zucchini.

9
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,867
I'm using 2 pounds of turkey
and for every pound of turkey,

10
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:47,200
I've grated 2 zucchinis.

11
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:52,569
So we've got quite a bit of
zucchini here, and it makes a

12
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:55,233
lot of juice but we want
that because turkey tends to be

13
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:58,167
really dry so that's why we're
putting the zucchini in there in

14
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,600
the first place so
it'll add some moisture.

15
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:04,139
So I want all of the
liquid--as much as I can get.

16
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:09,600
Try to balance that
and get it in the bowl.

17
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,037
Alright.

18
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,900
And then after I've added the
zucchini, I'm gonna add all of

19
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:16,376
my spices.

20
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,333
This is a really
easy, easy recipe.

21
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,340
It's got 1 measuring
spoon which is a teaspoon.

22
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:29,267
So I've got a teaspoon of pepper
here, 1 teaspoon of garlic,

23
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:36,639
1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon
of oregano, and then

24
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:42,600
2 teaspoons of onion powder
and 2 teaspoons of basil.

25
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,668
So that's it.

26
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:46,772
It's lots of green stuff.

27
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:51,800
And then I'm
gonna add the turkey.

28
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,537
Then this is where you
get your hands dirty.

29
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:04,800
You just reach in and
stir, mushing is out.

30
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,670
You never wanna over-work
protein because then it can tend

31
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:13,033
to get a little bit tough so
just really kinda squish and

32
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,467
pick it up and fold it
over until you get it all

33
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,470
incorporated.

34
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:24,239
You can make this same recipe
with really any sort of meat

35
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,900
whether it's beef or
maybe ground chicken breast.

36
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,342
I actually prefer lean
ground chicken breast but it's

37
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,200
actually--it's
really hard to find.

38
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:37,735
Not every butcher makes it or
every grocery store offers it.

39
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,233
It's looking pretty good.

40
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,400
Now I've already prepped my pan.

41
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:45,006
I covered it in foil because
this can get pretty messy.

42
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,739
The zucchini adds a lot of
liquid so sometimes it gets a

43
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:48,342
little runny.

44
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,234
You can make these on the grill
if you prefer, but for me the

45
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,100
broiler is just easy cleanup.

46
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:54,968
That's why I like it.

47
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:57,700
Now I just need to
form these into patties.

48
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:00,174
I get about a palm full,
and you wanna aim

49
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,133
for maybe
about 4 or 5 ounces.

50
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:09,200
This whole recipe makes
about nine to ten burgers.

51
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:17,167
This is actually a
really great low carb option.

52
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:21,600
Zucchinis are a carb, but
there's very few carbs in them.

53
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,533
This recipe's also
really versatile.

54
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,200
Instead of burgers, you could
make them into meatballs and put

55
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:33,009
them on spaghetti squash and
there's another low carb option.

56
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,542
For me, spaghetti squash is a
lifesaver whenever I'm sort of

57
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,167
in that low carb phase.

58
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:40,173
And something like this makes
me think that--or makes me feel

59
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,600
like I'm having spaghetti.

60
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:45,373
Also, using the grater to grate
up your vegetables and things

61
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,969
like that, not only does it add
moisture to your lean meats, but

62
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,173
it adds more volume so even
though it seems like maybe

63
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,776
your--like for instance,
if you're having a party or

64
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,300
something and you've gotta make
your dollar stretch, you can add

65
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:00,870
lots of grated vegetables to
things and it'll actually create

66
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,300
more food.

67
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:04,003
So the more zucchini I were
to grate up, if I only had

68
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:07,003
2 pounds of turkey, it actually
might make more patties.

69
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:07,970
So it looks like I'm done.

70
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,274
I'm gonna rinse my hands off.

71
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:10,973
Okay.

72
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,576
Now I've just gotta
get them in the oven.

73
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,775
With the broiler, you're
actually gonna treat it just

74
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:21,000
like a grill, and this one--
I usually like to do about

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,933
7 or 8 minutes
on each side depending

76
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,467
on how hot your oven is.

77
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,471
I'm gonna set mine for 7
minutes and then we'll open it,

78
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,933
flip 'em over, and do
7 minutes more.

79
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:36,673
Okay.

80
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,233
We've flipped the burgers, and
it's been 7 minutes on one

81
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,235
side and now 7 minutes
on the other.

82
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's get 'em out.

83
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,835
They look good.

84
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,467
So you always wanna make sure
it's done so we'll just kinda

85
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,600
poke into one and peak.

86
00:05:02,006 --> 00:05:03,039
No pink inside.

87
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,567
They're really juicy
so that's a good sign.

88
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,933
And then I guess we'll
just put one together.

89
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,267
You can eat them by themselves
if you're doing the low carb

90
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:15,533
thing or another option is to
use Ezekiel buns or any kind of

91
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:18,267
bread you really
want, but I prefer these.

92
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:21,633
They are only made from sprouted
grains so if you look at the

93
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,667
ingredients, there's nothing
artificial in them.

94
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,675
You can only find them
in the freezer section.

95
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:28,000
These are buns.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,333
These are an English
muffin which is another option.

97
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,300
And then you've also got just
the bread so different ones have

98
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:35,670
different calorie counts.

99
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,800
I think I'm gonna go
for an English muffin.

100
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:40,967
You can toast it.

101
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,033
You can leave them soft.

102
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:43,042
Whatever you'd like.

103
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:47,867
I'm gonna leave mine soft.

104
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,013
So then I've got my bun ready.

105
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:58,007
I'm gonna slice up a tomato.

106
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:06,000
Done a few slices, a
little bit of lettuce,

107
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:14,005
and then whatever condiments
you wanna put on this.

108
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:17,372
Ketchup works or
mustard might work.

109
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:18,733
I like the ketchup.

110
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,737
This is the
reduced sugar variety.

111
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:22,067
Just make sure you get one that
doesn't have high fructose corn

112
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,072
syrup in it.

113
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,576
So I'm gonna squeeze
some of that one there.

114
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,800
I like quite a bit.

115
00:06:27,008 --> 00:06:29,241
Get a patty.

116
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:34,500
Put that on there, and
then there's my burger.

117
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,800
It looks pretty good.

118
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:37,575
Alright.

119
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:43,333
I'm gonna take a bite.
See if I can get my mouth on it.

120
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,000
It tastes good.

121
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,007
Alright.
