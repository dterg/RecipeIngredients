00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:15,100
I'm Natalie Hodson, here
today in the bodybuilding.com

2
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,006
kitchen showing you how to make
a recipe that I make a lot of

3
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,239
mornings, and it's my
Blueberry Protein Pancake.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,067
This is a really good recipe.

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:25,069
If you're getting tired of the
same old egg whites and oats.

6
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:27,333
This uses the exact
same ingredients.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,467
It just mixes them
into a different way.

8
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,833
I know there's a lot of protein
pancake recipes out there, but I

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,841
like this one because it uses
all whole foods and it tastes

10
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:36,967
really good.

11
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,967
These are all the ingredients
that we're gonna use for today's

12
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:40,100
recipe.

13
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,168
We're gonna use 6 egg whites,

14
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:46,733
and 1/2 cup of old
fashion oats.

15
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:48,737
I like the old fashion oats
better than the instant oats

16
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,142
just because they're a
little bit less processed.

17
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:54,000
The instant oats have actually
been cooked and dehydrated to

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,967
make them cook
faster, and these haven't.

19
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,974
They've just been rolled.

20
00:00:58,667 --> 00:00:59,675
We have 1/4 cup of blueberries.

21
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:03,600
You can use fresh or frozen
or you can substitute it for

22
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,539
raspberries or strawberries.

23
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:09,767
We have 1/2 cup of
unsweetened vanilla almond milk.

24
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:13,500
And just make sure that when
you get the almond milk, you're

25
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,172
getting the
unsweetened vanilla kind.

26
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:16,700
I like the Almond Breeze brand.

27
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:19,007
It's 40 calories,
has no sugar in it.

28
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,040
Also, if you wanted, you
could substitute milk,

29
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,734
but I prefer the almond milk.

30
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,841
And then we have 1 teaspoon
of baking powder.

31
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:30,900
This is just to help the
pancakes rise a little bit.

32
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,013
Two packets of Truvia.

33
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,036
This is to make them
a little bit sweeter.

34
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,336
I have 1/2 cup of
unsweetened applesauce

35
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,367
and just a dash of cinnamon.

36
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,533
And those two items we're gonna
save 'til the end and use it as

37
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,800
a topping on top
of the pancakes.

38
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,041
So for today's recipe, I'm
actually gonna use a blender to

39
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,839
mix everything together.

40
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:49,267
And I'm gonna start with
my liquid ingredients.

41
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,274
Gonna pour in my almond milk,

42
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:58,767
and then I'm going to
do my egg whites.

43
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,500
And I'm just gonna crack
these right into the blender.

44
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,672
Now some people just throw their
yolks away into the trash can.

45
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,433
I actually like to put mine
in the garbage disposal, and I

46
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,567
found that out the hard way.

47
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,400
I used to just throw my yolks
into the trash can, and one day

48
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,007
I came home and my house smelled
really bad and I couldn't figure

49
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,340
out why.

50
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,567
And it's because I left the
yolks in the trash can for too

51
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:25,400
long, and so now what I do is
I'll just put them right into

52
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:26,008
the garbage disposal.

53
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:35,167
Some people like to feed the egg
yolks to their dog, and I guess

54
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:39,171
that helps with their coat and
makes it a little bit shinier.

55
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,333
And this is a really good
breakfast recipe if you have

56
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,600
kids.

57
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,573
I have a 2 year-old
and he loves this recipe.

58
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,500
We eat it a couple times a week.

59
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,438
And it's a really good way to
incorporate some whole grains

60
00:02:53,933 --> 00:02:56,400
into their diet, and the
blueberries has some really good

61
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:59,037
antioxidants.

62
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,400
Another thing you can do is you
can make these in bulk on the

63
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:04,937
weekend, and then freeze them.

64
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,367
I think they taste a little bit
better fresh but you definitely

65
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,370
can freeze them.

66
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:12,933
And when I do that I just put
them in a Ziploc bag and then

67
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,867
when I wanna eat them, I
stick them in the microwave

68
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,433
for about a minute.

69
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,571
Alright.

70
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,000
So we have 6 egg whites.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,433
Then I'm just gonna add my oats.

72
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,300
And I'm gonna save the
blueberries until we're actually

73
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,010
in the griddle.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,009
I'm gonna add my baking powder.

75
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,576
I'm just gonna do
a dash of salt.

76
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,473
It's probably about
1/8 of a teaspoon

77
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,075
if you were to measure it.

78
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:39,876
And then two packets of Truvia.

79
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:44,933
If you want to eat the pancakes
without any applesauce on top,

80
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,400
you could add a
third pack of Truvia.

81
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:49,237
It would make your pancakes
sweet so you wouldn't need to

82
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:51,641
add the applesauce on top.

83
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,300
And then I'm just gonna
blend this really fast.

84
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:11,867
Alright.

85
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:14,833
I'm quickly gonna turn my
skillet on to about medium-high

86
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,067
heat.

87
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,069
Then I'm just gonna spray it
with a little bit of non-stick

88
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,933
cooking spray.

89
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:27,933
And then I'm just gonna take my
batter and--this recipe makes

90
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:27,942
two pancakes.

91
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,600
Two pancakes is one serving so
usually just kinda eyeball it.

92
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,474
And put about half of the batter
in the skillet, and then I'm

93
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,933
gonna take half of my
blueberries and just drop them

94
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,967
in the top.

95
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,000
You can blend these, the
blueberries, in too if you want.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,367
I've done that before, but I
think it tastes a little better

97
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:50,100
this way.

98
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,634
Makes them a little bit juicier.

99
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:52,736
So we're just
gonna let this cook.

100
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,067
Usually you can tell they're
ready to flip when there's

101
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,074
bubbles in the
center of the pancake.

102
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:58,933
So I went ahead and
flipped the pancake.

103
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,938
We've been cooking it about
1 to 2 minutes on each side.

104
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:05,000
And sometimes the first pancake
doesn't flip quite as well as

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,009
the second pancake, and it's
because sometimes in the blender

106
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:10,142
the egg whites tend to kinda
stay at the top and the oats

107
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:14,567
fall to the bottom, but this
one turned out pretty good.

108
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:18,573
So I'm just gonna take the
pancake and put it on my plate.

109
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:24,470
I'll flip it I guess.
That side's not quite as pretty.

110
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:28,774
And then I'm gonna go ahead
and put my second pancake in.

111
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:32,733
I'm just gonna blend it for
just a second to get everything

112
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,067
shaken up.

113
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:37,013
Gonna spray my
pan with the spray.

114
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:51,500
Then I'm just gonna pour
the rest of my batter in.

115
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,013
Make sure to get
all those oats out.

116
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:58,007
And I'm gonna add the
rest of my blueberries.

117
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,800
And we're just gonna let it cook
about 1 to 2 minutes per side.

118
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,941
You know it's ready to flip
once the edges look like they're

119
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,767
cooked all the way through and
there's bubbles starting to form

120
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,100
in the center of the pancake.

121
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:13,568
Alright.

122
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,733
So we are done
cooking our second pancake.

123
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,736
I'm gonna go ahead and
put it on the plate.

124
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:22,473
Oops.

125
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,633
As you can see,
this is a lot of food.

126
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:27,635
This is another reason I
like this recipe is 'cause it's

127
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,200
really great way to start the
day with a nice hearty meal.

128
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,869
And then--the pancakes are
really sweet on their own I

129
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,400
think, and so a lot of times
I'll actually eat these even

130
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:38,837
without any applesauce on top.

131
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,300
You can use sugar free syrup if
you want, but I prefer to stay

132
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:44,170
away from that just because it
has a lot of preservatives in

133
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,633
it.

134
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:49,636
So sometimes if I want a little
extra something on top, I'll use

135
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,267
some unsweetened applesauce.

136
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,833
Just make sure you get the
applesauce that says no sugar

137
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,600
added or unsweetened or if you
read the ingredient list, the

138
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:00,015
only ingredients are apples,
water, and maybe ascorbic acid

139
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,013
which helps keep the coloring.

140
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,636
So I'm just gonna go with this
half of a cup of applesauce.

141
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:11,800
I'm just gonna pour it on top.

142
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:15,241
Sometimes I like to put
a little bit underneath.

143
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,000
And then I like cinnamon so I'm
gonna put a dash of cinnamon on

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,633
top.

145
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,639
You don't have to do that
if you don't like cinnamon.

146
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,000
Sprinkle a little cinnamon
on top and there you go.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,067
You have a really
good breakfast.

148
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,000
One serving is 2 pancakes, and
each serving has 6 egg whites,

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,633
and 1/2 a cup of oats,
some blueberries,

150
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,867
and some almond milk.

151
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,870
