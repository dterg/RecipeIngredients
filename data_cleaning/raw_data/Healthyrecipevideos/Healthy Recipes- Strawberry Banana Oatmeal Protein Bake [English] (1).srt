00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:16,013
i'm natalie hearts and I'm here today in
the bodybuilding icon kitchen show you

2
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:17,086
how to make my favorite recipes

3
00:00:17,086 --> 00:00:21,181
the strawberry banana oatmeal protein
shake he and I would see it make this

4
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,163
sorted as a healthier version from an
aggressive and creating banana bread I

5
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:27,111
know it's not very healthy for me

6
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,106
I make this instead and it's also a
really good meal that you can make on

7
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:33,015
the weekends you can make it in bulk

8
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:35,089
and you can keep it in your fridge
during the week we can also freeze that

9
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:37,127
so if you have to get out the door
really quickly in the morning

10
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:41,112
this is a great item you can meet for
your breakfast now so for today's recipe

11
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:43,056
these are the ingredients are going

12
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:47,069
going to you and we have dry ingredients
and wet ingredients organic separately

13
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:47,078
cell

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,067
for dry ingredients we have 2 cups I'll
fashion elf

15
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:54,146
and I prefer the old fashion out so the
ins and outs just because they've been a

16
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:57,113
little bit less processed the ins and
outs have actually been

17
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:02,028
flattened cooked and dehydrated and so
the old fashion it's just been rolled

18
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,124
and their little bit better for you and
then we have four scoops vanilla whey

19
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,024
protein powder

20
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:10,543
you can use any brand you prefer just
keep in mind that the different brand

21
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,350
will make it a slightly different

22
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:17,059
we have two tablespoons above ground
flaxseed and this is actually optional

23
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:21,078
but flack see cuz is forever may get 3
fatty acids

24
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:24,159
and they tell produced the LDL
cholesterol

25
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:29,097
the bad cholesterol in a full fiber and
antioxidants so to speak for a skillet a

26
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:29,172
healthier

27
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:33,168
and when you find a fax eat it comes in
a bad like this the thirty ground

28
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:38,154
in usual confinement in usually in the
baking aisle at the grocery store by the

29
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:40,128
other flowers and things like that

30
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,036
then we have 1 tablespoon of ground
cinnamon

31
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,407
we have one teaspoon baking powder

32
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,610
a fourth of a teaspoon us all and that's
just out the baking powder rains and

33
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:53,750
then we have

34
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,740
a half cup a stevia in the raw in that's
raised for this recipe if your trivia

35
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:04,743
or as I'll tell you can use that as well
and then for our wedding gradients I

36
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,150
have

37
00:02:06,015 --> 00:02:12,018
a half a cup unsweetened applesauce
which is also for answers this is the

38
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:13,051
kind I don't got one here

39
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,100
applesauce you just wanna make sure that
you get one this is no sugar added or

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,189
natural apple sauce

41
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,780
and the most important thing you can do
is read the ingredients list

42
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:24,081
so try to find one that all ingredients
are apples in water

43
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:28,113
and maybe ascorbic acid and that's just
my tendency to help keep the applesauce

44
00:02:29,013 --> 00:02:29,097
from turning brown

45
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:33,136
and sometimes I even what all do as I
get a little mark

46
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:37,065
containers that are for kids in that way
it's like perfect

47
00:02:37,065 --> 00:02:40,117
serving size: and I have those me
covered for my son anyways and I use a

48
00:02:41,017 --> 00:02:43,020
sometimes at the half a cup

49
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:47,118
and then we have 1/2 cups a unsweetened
vanilla almond milk

50
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:52,075
inanities almond milk amira fees and
settlement because it's low in calories

51
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,102
and has less sugar

52
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:58,061
and this is the kind I like iPhone for
his brand unsweetened vanilla almond

53
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,140
milk it only has 40 calories

54
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:03,069
just be careful when you're buying your
own not because from the flavors at

55
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,024
quite a bit of sugar

56
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,140
so again just read the ingredient list
and make sure that like this one has 0

57
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,029
grams of sugar in it

58
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,034
and then we're going to use

59
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,528
a fourth of a cup a love plain Greek
yogurt

60
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,590
in this is the Greek yogurt we have
today just again make sure that you're

61
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,083
getting the non-fat plain Greek yogurt
make sure you don't get one that's the

62
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,101
number flavored or any other flavor
because

63
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:29,020
we're gonna have a lot of sugar if you
look at the back

64
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,099
might have anywhere from five to eight
grams sugar and mother over sugars that

65
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,022
naturally occur in lactose

66
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:38,636
sound and then we're going to use for
egg whites I have my whole X hero

67
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,200
crackin weekly recipe

68
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:44,791
and I have two bananas for gonna slice
the israeli

69
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,890
then and then we have

70
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:51,186
four or five strawberries anyone get big
stories that the kinda small anything a

71
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:52,154
fiery

72
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:56,103
and sex and those are all the
ingredients were going to use it in a

73
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:57,062
recipe

74
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:00,118
burning so first we're going to do is
mix all over dry ingredients together in

75
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:01,577
a bowl

76
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,180
so you're going to take a larger mixing
all when you want it

77
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:08,053
but the dry ingredients in a large
mixing bowl because

78
00:04:08,053 --> 00:04:11,106
later intimate mix the wet ingredients
into the dry ingredients

79
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:15,009
so just quicker when green for 54
seconds

80
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:18,278
and then we're going to mix to cut serve

81
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,680
0 of for scoops a

82
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:25,136
protein powder our factory

83
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,082
one tablespoon have

84
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:33,129
settlement half cup a

85
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:40,188
stevia in there a 1 teaspoon

86
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,290
baking powder in

87
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:48,121
8430 soon as I saw and then

88
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:52,078
think my whiskey and thanks for
everything gets mixed together really

89
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:53,109
well

90
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:57,102
sometimes they have gotten lazy and not
make that together

91
00:04:58,002 --> 00:05:01,091
very well and my baking powder doesn't
evenly distributes

92
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:04,107
and then when it could have a bit kenna
if

93
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:09,035
flatter than the rest I just wanna make
sure the sentiment is gets evenly

94
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:14,060
distributed in the baking powder

95
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:17,100
interest until you can see anymore you
know brown spots are white spots isn't

96
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,105
it looks nice unmixed

97
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:24,041
out this looks pretty good finance at
the set aside

98
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:30,047
and then mexico are wet ingredients

99
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:33,131
and doesn't really matter what order
rent-a-car almond milk

100
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:41,031
are Greek yogurt in the Greek yogurt
just add some moisture to the recipe

101
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:45,150
and actually in any recipe

102
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:51,028
you can substitute Greek yogurt or
applesauce for the better and the oil in

103
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:51,138
a recipe

104
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:55,079
so now we're going to put in our
applesauce

105
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,171
industries a rubber spatula to get it
all out

106
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,073
and then we're gonna put interact with

107
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:07,135
now little trick I learned

108
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,107
I use it just for my egg whites in the
trash can and

109
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:15,068
for some reason I cannot figure out why
my house found that out

110
00:06:15,068 --> 00:06:18,129
time and then one day I want to go take
out the trash and

111
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:23,038
it was rose I could tell a great for egg
yolk for seeping through the bottom in

112
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:23,046
the trash bag

113
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:29,035
and my we realize that it was because I
was eating so many egg whites reference

114
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,089
only and get some trash can

115
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,151
and so now I just throw them in the
garbage disposal

116
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:39,053
that way it doesn't think upper half I
know some people have dogs actually let

117
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,069
their dogs ether

118
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,125
egg yolks and it's good for their coats
but

119
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:47,042
you have any pets %uh to see the garbage
disposal

120
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:53,089
house one

121
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,131
you also could do the liquid egg whites
if you wanna

122
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:02,057
that are come in a carton to sling trees
a little bit less than

123
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:06,123
than ratio calls for me think

124
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:13,100
now I'm gonna take my mistake my Wes can
just makes us all together really well

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,042
sometimes birth egg white skin kinda

126
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:21,056
stick together a little bit sound slick
centel

127
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:24,150
it looks nice and unmixed

128
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:28,031
then we're gonna bring over my

129
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:31,147
Nick starring gradients you were just
going to

130
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:39,047
combine the and stern altogether

131
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:44,100
have a two-year-old and this is his
favorite part

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,052
I let him usually do you this fine
cutting up the bananas or

133
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:53,079
from handle him cut the bananas with me
kinda fun to get the kids involved with

134
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,120
this recipe

135
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:01,029
it's also a really healthy male you get
your your kids to get some whole grains

136
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:01,143
into your diet

137
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:07,054
rights another that's makes women
prepare

138
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:12,081
RPN to the side in risk amuse and

139
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,165
agent spy p.m. you could use a 9-inch
pie pan as well

140
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:21,066
if you're happy and you could even just
use a a square castro this

141
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:28,066
men just really lightly spray and I
don't use a lot of the stuff

142
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:35,053
but I just use the nonstick cooking
spray and

143
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:38,124
take a cutting board

144
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:43,060
you were gonna take one for bananas and
we're just gonna

145
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:48,087
slice a relief then can

146
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:56,041
if Houston pretty thin slices because
you want another

147
00:08:57,023 --> 00:09:00,024
banana slices that you can wear the
entire bottom obtain

148
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:07,024
now finance

149
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,150
and turn color after they've been
exposed to the air

150
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:15,081
and so know always but sometimes I
neighbors does performer and if I let

151
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:19,094
said the fridge for a couple days it
kenna turns on with her

152
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:22,094
a purplish color stuff that happens to
you don't be

153
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,125
alarm that's not there's nothing wrong
with its just because the banana

154
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:31,061
once they get exposed to the area they
can change color so now what I'm doing

155
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:34,098
is undertaking the banana slices and
lining the bottom other p.m.

156
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:37,113
and after I'm done

157
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:41,031
whining this then we're gonna pour the
batter on top but the main

158
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:44,100
so they say when you bite into it you
have banana

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,007
taste on the bottom and they were gonna
put another way opinion is on the top

160
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:52,056
alright so this looks pretty good now
what we're gonna do is pour the batter

161
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,103
on top of the banana

162
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:59,015
means just evenly distributed there

163
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,038
gonna sell the pana

164
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:05,136
all the way to the edge men just

165
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:13,036
screen about the rest honor and then
what we're going to do is

166
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:18,079
slice our second banana we're gonna do
the same things are going to put a nice

167
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,110
where bananas on top

168
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:24,073
and not only does this

169
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,153
make it taste good but it also

170
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:33,085
exodus really pretty

171
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:37,088
so the ferry slice rebellion is the more
you're gonna be able to

172
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:44,088
put across can

173
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:56,009
in this recipe makes 4 servings so one
serving really just has

174
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:00,015
one egg lay a scooper of protein powder

175
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:04,144
and have a couple votes plus a little
bit Greek yogurt a little bit on the

176
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:09,107
milk it does have half a banana on a
little bit %uh spices

177
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:13,060
so this is a really good option for

178
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,023
breakfast in

179
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:19,172
if you kinda getting tired of just
regular old egg whites and

180
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:23,107
you

181
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:28,068
okay so

182
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:33,080
and distribute the very evenly some
military inskeep from these bananas over

183
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:37,045
XP and then wanna do is take my
strawberries and again I'm gonna slice

184
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:38,063
pays

185
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:41,078
family then can you don't have to

186
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:44,121
at history's if you don't you know if
you don't have them you can just do the

187
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:48,054
bananas and I say about this recipe is
it's really versatile to you really

188
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,120
could use any kind for

189
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:53,034
I've done this before with peaches that
was pretty good

190
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:56,066
I've done it with blackberries you could
do it with

191
00:11:56,066 --> 00:12:00,144
Apple's you could do it with raspberries
really whatever fruit from cell that

192
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,058
week

193
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:08,072
you could get with raspberries if you
really cared

194
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:13,094
and then I just put the strawberries on
top

195
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:19,095
like that

196
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:24,023
yeah i four before serve reserve five
star Bruce

197
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:27,120
and just too so it's not like that

198
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:32,077
self that say I'm we have other merit
preheated the oven to 375 degrees

199
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:35,141
some realistic this and other than and
we are going to cook it for about forty

200
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,095
to forty-five minutes

201
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:40,150
basically the top is going to be a
golden brown and you know it's done once

202
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:44,081
you put a knife in the center and the
knife comes out clean

203
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:51,032
of right side effects %uh then we could
differ forty-five minutes of

204
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:57,125
and I'm just gonna test it to make sure
that the knife comes out clean

205
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:01,061
looks pretty good and as you can

206
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:04,106
see the top %uh this is going to be kind
of a golden brown color

207
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:08,059
in what I'm gonna do is let it sit here
and rest for between five to 10 minutes

208
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,107
just until it cools if I tried to cut
into it now it would also give collapse

209
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:12,084
together

210
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,099
sir gonna let it cool and set for about
five to ten minutes

211
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:19,107
and then after that I will cut it into
fourths one serving

212
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:25,089
is one wage say I just usually just use
a butter knife

213
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:30,147
handcuffed Throop

214
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:36,050
mmm sometimes like to take my knife and
ran it along the

215
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:39,113
fly just in case

216
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:43,039
so doesn't stick

217
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:50,039
premiums can take a serving his home
phone

218
00:13:54,004 --> 00:14:00,035
pull out 11 in there you go so what I
might do with

219
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:05,056
is cut in half again or just to see that
like bad saw this looks really good I'm

220
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:05,145
gonna try by

221
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:13,045
and see how it tastes

222
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:19,129
