get started

11
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:45,711
for this test if you really need three
cats and kristie brown nice

12
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:47,090
you need one cap of

13
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,045
polenz

s_s_-eighteen's seemed very easy and it
can cnr really really quickly

21
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:21,058
i do we need is basically a large bowl
seeking dot all the ingredients and

22
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:22,917
healing is smaller bowl

23
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
so that we can see this in mind kareem

24
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:29,094
cc that just a little bit is that it's
easier to actually makes intact angry

25
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:29,162
teams

26
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:35,076
and once he had experienced and and we
stick it in the freezer no baking at all

27
00:01:35,076 --> 00:01:39,174
and he can get about thirty minutes to
beginning to be the added already three

28
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:42,075
cups of the kristie brown ranks

29
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,973
now you can help me find this and that
one eight-year local grocery stories

30
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:49,270
i've seen in a whole foods i missed
every time

31
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:52,053
and the reason i like this it's going
three it's really gotten very few

32
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:52,922
reviews

33
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,270
it does have some natural sugar in it
but it's from the back-breaking gisenyi

34
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:58,058
certainly lastest

35
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:00,070
says only got to be in sugar

36
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:04,176
per serving which is three forced the
captain we've got three cuts in here so

37
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,881
here looking at less than five musician
air fleet in tyre vaccine you're not

38
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:10,997
fifty entire baxter

39
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,620
three cats cannibal emily got one cup of
politics

40
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:17,321
strengthen family time

41
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,220
and then we're gonna agate a fourth of
the skip of

42
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:25,053
crest almonds so you can actually hear
alan if you'd like to just

43
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:28,139
use your your testing rolling pin you
know beaten down that way

44
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:33,968
or you can buy marty talk to the store
which is what we have

45
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,345
son had a fourth of the cut

46
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,582
sprinkle it around because we don't
actually mix it up to mentioned so we

47
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:42,620
have the rest of angry antennae

48
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,540
and the last thing they need for drying
greens is one skip of protein

49
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:48,090
something then

50
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:52,090
an army guys always ask me what kind of
thirteen days whenever camp eighteen

51
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,123
unite i dislike something that's going
to be roughly work is it's usually a

52
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,072
good base

53
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,295
for everything

54
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,442
and i always look for the few begins the
better but whichever one you like some

55
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,810
people like you added in the news and

56
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,167
and and all 'cause ancilla things that
they can get you know added nutrition

57
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,946
monroe easy scoops up

58
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,280
barrett undisputed intimacy

59
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,227
don't mix that yet because it all settle
to the bottom

60
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,516
set that aside

61
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,898
and now i'm a startling mellanby sand

62
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,407
we you can start with only better

63
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,150
now when you got a step of the store

64
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:31,034
make sure that you can email and that is
just

65
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,430
on these insults or just earnings don't
anything that has the added worlds

66
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:39,402
as you can see there's a kind of a lil
hardin top

67
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,842
anecdote for often someone of a don't
don't choir off their tickets

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,230
you have a really hard time

69
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,032
mixing it up all in the bottom

70
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:52,701
so animate set just a little bit

71
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:55,005
united at that time

72
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:57,208
we need

73
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:58,831
three-fourths of the practice

74
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:00,490
so

75
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,008
i want to use my one quick skip i think
it's a little bit more manageable

76
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,498
so i'll just before that in

77
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,955
won't do that

78
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,101
three times sent that going on

79
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:12,396
i'm a little

80
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,510
revver spatula

81
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,670
to get out

82
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,213
three

83
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,870
and i do you can get one of the best
parts of this recipe is that

84
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,086
it's really whatever you want

85
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:27,620
to pray

86
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:31,501
immense if you wanted to use your pena
bad air or to see me which is crest

87
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:34,061
sesame scenes or

88
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,143
and canon that there's a way really you
can use anything

89
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:42,736
and that is true that the next day
cheeses while he concedes that everyone

90
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:43,870
so one more

91
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,158
and as you can see this is a lot of
healthy fats

92
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:48,090
your forewarned at this point

93
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,095
this is not something the every single
day but it's a great snack it we have

94
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:57,157
actually that's my laura will be running
in and and burning a lot of calories so

95
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:01,121
this would be great for that because
it's great for energy

96
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:09,021
right he's being a little stubborn but i
think again it off

97
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,554
canes that continue

98
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:14,430
you've got are three fourths of the cut

99
00:05:14,043 --> 00:05:18,002
nangi needed two cups of hiney

100
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,451
sela and honey of course will still
spike your blood sugar balcony is so

101
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:24,065
good for units

102
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,666
and their dignity accidents there's all
sorts of benefits to so organic add that

103
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,552
in

104
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,683
again this isn't for everyday
consumption dates can be an awesome ci

105
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:40,050
katie's unreal actually for sophia needs

106
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,874
circuit batting

107
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,770
meyer

108
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:48,096
you can

109
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,090
and actually hunt can find scenic is at
the story of finite

110
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,036
all different kinds are adhesion my
assignments like lavender favor it or

111
00:05:57,036 --> 00:06:00,088
and allen that is risley everglades not
so much that i really felt i was

112
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:02,143
chatting online or something makan

113
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,032
syndrome

114
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,476
begat that and then

115
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,071
sequence and you had a

116
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:08,898
i have to cut

117
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,430
of is our top answers are planned

118
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:16,047
and you've don't have to use if you
don't want to you because you're kinda

119
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,226
batman honey

120
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:21,710
and that this will come a kick out the
intensity of dayton aikido and cedar i

121
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,300
think it really adds a lot today

122
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,019
anytime absent carries

123
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:29,121
but unlike share here which is like
three point seven there's something like

124
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:31,049
that for sugar

125
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:35,071
and this is only two point something so
it's it's the lesson actually its

126
00:06:35,071 --> 00:06:38,230
approved for diabetics because
inspection flights again last so

127
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,550
weren't there that in there

128
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:43,884
i didn't see this one at a alternative
some of you may or may not be familiar

129
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,426
with second i'm

130
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:49,893
it's actually a brown sugar substitute
is well eighty tasting it's really

131
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,360
greenlee

132
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:55,575
that it does have a little bit of the
hands of the masses favor added to it

133
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,908
and with that picture sugar anything so
this is definitely an option for you

134
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,857
so once we put this in the bull

135
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:09,379
underneath in the microwave

136
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:17,448
emergency needs you thirty sec intervals
is all we need an inmate this back of

137
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:24,619
the year he's really needed to start
mixing this together

138
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:31,122
sometimes it just takes one sometimes it
takes

139
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,472
a little longer amit actually getting
bigger stocks or no

140
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,973
say that he did at really loved

141
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:45,246
makes it all together

142
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,806
you really just heating it just enough
to so they'll spread easily insight here

143
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:54,243
i think it's actually pretty good if he
needed to you can do you another thirty

144
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,453
seconds and migraines

145
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,800
so uh... i mean even before that in

146
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:04,022
mckenna sprinted out a little bit

147
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:05,161
and get on about

148
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,750
it's going to siem reap there's really
not a nafta can go around at first that

149
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,346
you just have to really working

150
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:13,818
so

151
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,302
man to start working together and i
think i mean it's this little fold over

152
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,090
techniques in it

153
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,858
kaczynski since that time

154
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,270
rangeen

155
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:29,706
so he can start chopping instead

156
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,180
now you can actually ag

157
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:35,107
tried three a_t_t_ one-inch if this is
the occasion i know a lot of a steely

158
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,075
from dr three state

159
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,604
and he did all kinds and that's actually

160
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,800
i wanna it's too

161
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:45,024
and keen explain every bite

162
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,285
all right i think really compete again

163
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,630
and see if you dress spots but i think i
can fix that one critic principle

164
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:57,101
cell andy's any nineteen thirteen
current status

165
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:01,034
and you can use it every day she back i
just find that works well because they

166
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:04,096
don't need to spread anything there's no
public that's near you that you don't

167
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:07,149
have to add any non-stick spray has
anything like that

168
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:13,138
re-arming comment my days

169
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:21,038
for this in

170
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:28,125
ni training kit is started i mean that's
you can see

171
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:36,025
coming is starting with your stocks last

172
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:40,109
and that i like to finish it with my
fingers i think it's use you to really

173
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:46,075
get pushed down in their so what you
think it's just a little bit

174
00:09:46,075 --> 00:09:51,109
so it doesn't stick and say i really
