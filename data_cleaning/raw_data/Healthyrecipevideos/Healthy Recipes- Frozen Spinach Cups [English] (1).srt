1
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:15,180
i'm natalie happen here nobody will not
come kitchen showing you how to make

2
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,044
frozen spinach cap

3
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:21,017
this is a really easy orbited a recipe

4
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:24,072
is this to thicken high protein shakes
and it's great because we put in a

5
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:24,721
protein shake

6
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:29,320
you really can't even taste it now just
turn your protein shake screen so if you

7
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,151
have an issue with the color

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,400
protein shake and you can if you will
very to it turns that purple and then

9
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:34,045
you

10
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:38,138
don't see the green color and spirits is
a cream dark green leafy vegetable which

11
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,130
is really good it's high in vitamin A&E

12
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:45,081
an Israeli high in iron and calcium as
well so for the ingredients for Denny's

13
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:46,013
today

14
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:49,156
we're going to use pennants in usually
up by between a 6-3 eight-ounce bag

15
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:52,120
different brands have different sizes
that they sound but

16
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:56,019
just one bag of spinach and then

17
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:59,091
water and here have two cups of water in

18
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:03,660
your we may not use the full two cups
were gonna do is add the spinach in

19
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,493
Philly at the water

20
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:09,320
until for consistency that we need and
then you're gonna need a blender

21
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:12,511
and then we're going to use a muffin tin
pan as well he and what we're gonna do

22
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,870
you want to go and everything together
we're gonna pour the

23
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,850
like went into the muffin tin pan and
then free that way

24
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,169
so this just feels really simple all you
do is you put your spin into the blender

25
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,288
and I just take and falls in

26
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,860
and put it in and

27
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:34,135
you're gonna start by filling about
almost all the way for

28
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:40,094
and then my rule of thumb is about half
a cup of water per two handfuls of

29
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,390
spinach so

30
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,113
and I just kinda pour the water in

31
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:49,018
there it looks like we use about 1 cup
so we'll start with and then slowly add

32
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:50,162
water and mountains

33
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,200
and then you just put the lid on your
lender

34
00:01:54,002 --> 00:02:01,002
can be kinda loud

35
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,164
rights as you can see it really

36
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,491
plans down quite a bit and so

37
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:13,150
but I'm gonna do. is actually at some
worse than its

38
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:17,058
you're gonna have their s first then
it's in here

39
00:02:17,058 --> 00:02:23,077
and then we're just gonna keep lending
it I'm I don't think I need to add more

40
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:23,606
water

41
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:27,368
I'm just gonna kinda blender if it gets
too thick you basically want it

42
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,690
to pick a liquid consistency maybe a
little bit think you're not quite as

43
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,148
thick as a milkshake consistency

44
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:40,048
me

45
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,104
I think this looks pretty good basically

46
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:56,077
you swimming crown fine enough they
don't have big chance with

47
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:59,132
minutes and then what ideas I take this
and I just

48
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:04,073
poor right into my mouth and 10 and the

49
00:03:04,073 --> 00:03:07,079
I usually fill these pretty much all the
way for

50
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:12,035
because what I do is and I'll show you
later as I just

51
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:15,089
use one each my protein shakes

52
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:18,090
so it looks like this: made

53
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,141
about six and so we could

54
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:26,052
double this if we wanted and May 12 and
freeze all 12 but today I think we're

55
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:28,096
just gonna make of 6 I'm gonna stick
this in the freezer

56
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:30,181
and then just let it freeze for about
three hours you can even leave it in

57
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:32,103
there for longer a few

58
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:36,076
our home after three hours and then
we're gonna puppies out pulling the plug

59
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:38,110
back east to keep them in the freezer to
use for

60
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:46,001
are protein shakes later in the week

61
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:56,984
so I just took the Spanish cuts out of
the freezer they've been in the freezer

62
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,150
for about three hours

63
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:03,083
and as you can tell they're rock-solid
so you can you want two things you can't

64
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,148
just let them sit on the counter for few
minutes until their

65
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:09,387
melted a little bit and you can pop them
out or what I like to do it a little bit

66
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,150
faster as I'm just going around the
bottom of the pan and any some hot water

67
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:20,015
me

68
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:31,019
like to see the threat

69
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:32,132
in than what I like to do

70
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:37,117
is just to take a butter knife and
obviously when I can use all 60 the

71
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:38,093
Spanish Cup

72
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:41,152
in a protein shake it once and so I just
take the plot fact

73
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:45,100
I thought usually three or four the
Spanish cups and has a point back and I

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,005
saw them in the freezer

75
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:50,012
for that way later when I gotta make a
protein shake

76
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:54,048
I can describe a one-out Astley's these
when I make smoothies fruit smoothies

77
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:54,054
for me

78
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,103
two-year-old it's one of the few ways I
can get him to next call's

79
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:02,080
so I'm just gonna pop the Spanish Cup
out of

80
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:06,029
that's what it looks like and go ahead

81
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:10,005
a little bit messy but can just read
your hands when you're done

82
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:17,041
of 43 in a bag

83
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:26,074
terms I tried to fit too many in there
in and the cat to vet

84
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:37,114
I up

85
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:44,045
I'm gonna just for two in this bag and
we're gonna save one

86
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:47,096
to use in a protein shake today to make
the protein shake

87
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,097
I like to use unsweetened almond milk
'it's

88
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:54,071
come with the no I just make sure you
get the one that has 35 or 40 calories

89
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:58,096
and rethinking gradient last because
some almond milk for do add sugar

90
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:01,175
you wanna make sure unsweetened kind
without any sector if you have on now if

91
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,093
you could also use water or regular milk

92
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,157
I usually use about

93
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:14,123
eight ounces or so I just kinda by paula
and then means you 1 skills love

94
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:19,072
whey protein you can use you can you
finish up with any flavor and brand

95
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:23,105
and then

96
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:28,026
sensitive ice I'm going to use my frozen
spinach company what it's gonna do is

97
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:31,051
it's gonna take a nap the shape and also

98
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:34,094
add from good vitamins vitamin E Kelsey
Ann

99
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:41,094
has complained that up

100
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:01,047
it looks pretty good

101
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:04,076
I'm just gonna portent

102
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:07,128
my Cup

103
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,115
so it doesn't remember shake a
green-collar

104
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:14,092
and if I can wear you out you can have
some blueberry service and then it turns

105
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:14,157
the purple

106
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:18,070
and actually my son won't drink some of
their green but if they have some

107
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,071
blueberries in the turns and purple

108
00:07:20,034 --> 00:07:23,037
then he has no clue in hearing from just
fine fell

109
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:28,135
he's like a protein shake you can even
taste the spinach

110
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:33,099
