Hi, I'm Jamie Eason and today
I'm in the BODYBUILDING.COM

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,967
kitchen and I'm showing you
how to make my

4
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:26,500
chocolate peanut butter
protein crisps.

5
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,272
In a previous video I showed you
how to make my honey, almond,

6
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,100
protein crisps.

7
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,568
But now we're gonna use two of
my other favorite ingredients:

8
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,066
chocolate and peanut butter.

9
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,233
So, let's get started.

10
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:40,066
The ingredients for our
chocolate, peanut butter,

11
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:44,133
protein crisps are three
cups of a crispy brown rice,

12
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:49,066
we've got 1 cup of whole oats,
a scoop of a vanilla whey

13
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:52,333
protein powder, we've got
some crushed almonds,

14
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,333
some peanut butter
right here, some cocoa,

15
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,340
and some brown sugar,
and somewhere around here

16
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:00,767
I've got my honey.

17
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,800
That's all you're gonna
need, so let's get started.

18
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:06,008
To start I've put 3 cups
of the crispy brown rice.

19
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,474
And just so you see.

20
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,867
You can have a reference.

21
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:10,874
This is the crispy
brown rice I used.

22
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,570
It's gluten-free, organic.

23
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,700
It's got very few
ingredients in it.

24
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,012
It does have a
little bit of sugar.

25
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:18,335
It's natural sugar.

26
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,534
It's got organic molasses
and evaporated cane juice.

27
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,500
But it's 2 grams per serving.

28
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,013
There's 3/4 of a
cup in a serving,

29
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:27,336
so you've got less than 5 grams
of natural sugar in the whole

30
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:30,166
entire recipe, so not bad.

31
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,734
It makes 18 servings.

32
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,066
So, we've started with
that, put that in.

33
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:37,100
And then I've got my
cup of whole oats.

34
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,067
I'm gonna put that on top.

35
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:45,100
And then I'm gonna add
1/4 cup of crushed almonds.

36
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,234
So, if you don't
have crushed almonds,

37
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,341
you can actually just take
your own almonds, you know,

38
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,200
scoop out 1/4 of a cup of
those and just beat them

39
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:53,469
with a rolling pin.

40
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:55,676
You can use the back of
a pot, whatever you have.

41
00:01:56,567 --> 00:02:00,133
And then, on top of that I'm
gonna add 1 scoop of

42
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:02,066
vanilla whey protein powder.

43
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:05,233
I kind of sprinkle that on
top, spread it around a bit.

44
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,700
Now, do not mix this up.

45
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,012
We don't want to make all of
the protein powder settle

46
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,369
to the bottom.

47
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,569
So, I just give it a gentle
shake and then I'm gonna set it

48
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,100
to the side.

49
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,009
So, now I'm gonna switch out
to a smaller bowl and in this

50
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,576
bowl--now make sure
you use a glass bowl.

51
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,133
That's important because we're
gonna need to put it

52
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,467
in the microwave.

53
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:28,600
So, we're gonna start out
with our main ingredient,

54
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:32,439
which is an all natural,
unsalted creamy peanut butter.

55
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:36,066
You can use chunky if you like,
but the chunky actually doesn't

56
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,567
seem to mix up quite as well.

57
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,567
But I have made it and it
tastes really good too.

58
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,300
So, it's just your preference.

59
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,836
There's a lot of natural oil
that comes up from the peanuts,

60
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:48,700
so we're gonna pour a
little bit of that off.

61
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:50,174
Don't pour it all out though,
because you'll really have

62
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,600
a hard time mixing it up.

63
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,539
So, I'm gonna go
ahead and mix it--see,

64
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,900
it's already kind of hard.

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,642
Let's see.

66
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,734
I have to get the
muscle in there.

67
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:03,066
Mix it up a bit.

68
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:04,900
Alright.

69
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,943
And so, we're gonna actually
take 3/4 of a cup of a creamy,

70
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:12,367
all natural peanut butter
and add that to the bowl.

71
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,500
So, I like to use my
little smaller scoop.

72
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,472
I think it's more manageable,
but you can use a measuring cup

73
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,200
and just measure to 3/4.

74
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:24,235
So, I'm going to scoop it
out and put it in there.

75
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:27,266
This one looks slightly
chunky, slightly smooth,

76
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:30,667
so I think I needed to maybe
stir it up a little longer.

77
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,669
Sometimes I've been known to
heat it up a little bit in

78
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,800
the microwave just to get it
going, but--let's see.

79
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,441
So, we've got our 1/4 going.

80
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:45,237
Do some more.

81
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:50,500
And you don't have to be
super, super careful with

82
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,172
the measurements in
this actual recipe.

83
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,066
You can add a little, take
away a little if you want.

84
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:58,467
I've actually figured out the
ratios just to have just enough

85
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:01,472
so you don't have to--they
don't end up too dry,

86
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:04,300
'cause we want them to
stick together a bit.

87
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:06,006
We're trying to make that crispy
rice and everything kind of all

88
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:08,472
come together, so that
when we freeze it,

89
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:12,467
it actually makes this crunchy,
crispy, kind of granola.

90
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:16,000
I've almost got it all out.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,767
This one's more challenging
that the almond butter.

92
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,934
Now, with that said, you could
use the almond butter

93
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,567
if you'd like.

94
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,900
And you can actually
add extracts.

95
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:27,776
So, if you wanted to make say
chocolate with like a little bit

96
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,333
of orange--hint of orange or
something or there's

97
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,934
coconut extracts.

98
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,700
There's bananas--maybe
chocolate, peanut butter,

99
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,008
banana might be pretty good.

100
00:04:37,008 --> 00:04:38,015
You could actually use little
pieces of banana

101
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,010
if you'd like too.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,367
But they will get a little mushy
and that'll make it not stick

103
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,734
together as well.

104
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:48,033
So, use that sparingly
or do the dried bananas.

105
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:51,033
But, again, that's added sugar,
so just be careful about how

106
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,035
much you're using, 'cause we're
already using quite a bit of

107
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,066
natural sugar.

108
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:58,300
Next thing I'm gonna add
is gonna be my honey.

109
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:01,270
So, we're gonna do
1/2 cup of honey.

110
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,033
So, since this is my 1/4
measuring scoop I'm gonna do

111
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,400
2 of these.

112
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,004
So, we've got one.

113
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:13,538
Need my little spatula.

114
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,767
Now, honey is really,
really, really good for you.

115
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:20,333
I'm often asked about honey
versus agave and if agave

116
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,767
is better.

117
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:22,776
I personally prefer honey.

118
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,734
I think there's so many
health benefits to it with

119
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,600
the antioxidants.

120
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,011
And it's good for your skin.

121
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,568
It's a good antibacterial.

122
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,100
There's just so many great
things about it that I'd prefer

123
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,534
to use it, 'cause agave in truth
it'll still spike your

124
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,367
blood sugar.

125
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:42,100
So, be careful because a lot of
times some of those labels can

126
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,868
be misleading and make you think
that that's a better choice,

127
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:48,300
but it actually still pretty
much does the same thing.

128
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:51,969
So, alright, we've got those two
ingredients in the bowl and now

129
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:56,900
I'm gonna add 1/2 cup actually
of xylitol brown sugar blend.

130
00:05:56,009 --> 00:05:57,742
Xylitol is a sweetener.

131
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:01,166
It comes from like
raspberries, plums.

132
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,400
It's a natural
fructose sweetener.

133
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:04,012
And it's actually
a sugar alcohol.

134
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:08,569
It does not have quite as many
calories as regular sugar,

135
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,433
but it still will have a
slight insulin spike.

136
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,300
It's just a little
bit better for you.

137
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:14,370
It is organic.

138
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,233
It is natural.

139
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,000
They actually use it in
toothpaste 'cause it's good

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,533
for our teeth.

141
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,967
So, I'm gonna dump that in.

142
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,133
and the brown sugar part adds a
little bit of molasses flavor

143
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,137
to what we're making.

144
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:27,100
If you really prefer, you can
look for something like

145
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:32,002
organic sucanat, which it has
15 calories per teaspoon.

146
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:35,169
So you're adding some calories,
but it's less sweetness as far

147
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,370
as like less grams of sugar,
but it also tastes less sweet.

148
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,600
So, you might end up
having to use more.

149
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:43,006
So, for me I just like to use
this and just kind of eat it

150
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,839
sparingly, so.

151
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,834
Alright.

152
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:49,767
Into that I want to add--let's
see we've got vanilla.

153
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm gonna do a
teaspoon of vanilla.

154
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,571
And then I'm going
to add my chocolate.

155
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,800
Now, the chocolate the
preference is up to you.

156
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,075
You can add a
couple tablespoons.

157
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,200
You can add a lot
of tablespoons.

158
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,035
You can use dark chocolate,
Hershey's chocolate,

159
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,242
whatever kind
you'd like to use.

160
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,767
Some people like cacao.

161
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:12,775
You could use
anything you'd like.

162
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,576
So, I'm gonna open that up.

163
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,476
Let's do 3 of those.

164
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:21,633
I prefer for the recipe
to use dark chocolate.

165
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,642
So, if you can find
the unsweetened dark chocolate,

166
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,834
I think that's
probably your best bet.

167
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:31,066
So, I'm gonna stir this up just
a little bit just to get

168
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:34,333
the dry stuff incorporated
a little.

169
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,166
And then we want to stick this
in the microwave for just about

170
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,767
30 seconds just to
kind of soften it up.

171
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:44,767
So, I can stir it all together.

172
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:05,100
Alright, let's stir
this together a bit.

173
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:10,002
You want to get all of the dry
ingredients incorporated into

174
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:13,968
the wet, so it's
doing pretty well.

175
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,800
You might have to stick it
in there for maybe another

176
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,017
30 seconds to really
get it pliable.

177
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,011
I think I'm gonna do that
with--when you add all of

178
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,334
the cocoa and everything it's
not quite as liquefied as one of

179
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,467
the other recipes that we made
like the honey, almond,

180
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,333
protein crisps.

181
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,340
So, let me stick that back
in for 30 more seconds.

182
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,700
Don't do the minute all at once,
because you could burn

183
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:40,640
your chocolate and we
definitely don't want that.

184
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,834
Alright.

185
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,266
Let's stir this together a bit.

186
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,767
Yeah, that's much
easier to stir.

187
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,700
So, now that I've
got it all out,

188
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:07,141
I'm gonna go ahead and pour that
on top of our dry ingredients.

189
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,467
There we go.

190
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,934
Now it's pouring.

191
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:15,467
It smells really good.

192
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,100
I could probably just eat the
chocolate and peanut butter,

193
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:25,134
but--let's see.

194
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,700
This one I don't
share with my dog,

195
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:30,674
'cause she can't have chocolate.

196
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:35,368
So, I'm gonna fold the dry
ingredients over the top.

197
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,133
I like to do the little
folding technique,

198
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:40,400
'cause it keeps my spatula
from getting too sticky

199
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:45,006
right off the bat.

200
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:47,839
Alright.
And it doesn't look like much.

201
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,433
You have to really work it
to start getting all

202
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,867
the wet ingredients
incorporated into the dry.

203
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:59,033
So, it might take a little bit
of work, a little bit of muscle.

204
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,900
So, I think I've
almost got it all done.

205
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,275
If you can see the protein
powder still in there,

206
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,100
you've got to probably
keep stirring, which I can.

207
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:11,004
So, I'm gonna keep
going a second.

208
00:10:11,004 --> 00:10:13,271
It might look a bit dry
and you don't want to add

209
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,800
a lot of liquid though,
because if you do,

210
00:10:15,008 --> 00:10:18,017
it'll end up getting
too soft and fall apart.

211
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,940
So, I think it
looks pretty good.

212
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:25,834
Now, we end up putting this in
the freezer so it can get hard,

213
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,633
but do know that after a while
if you take it out of the

214
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,900
freezer, it's gonna get softer
and softer and it still

215
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:32,014
tastes awesome.

216
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:34,571
It's just not quite
the same texture,

217
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,800
because of course the peanut
butter and everything softens up

218
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:37,575
a little bit.

219
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:41,633
So, I think we're good.

220
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:45,367
And I'm gonna show you first and
foremost how I make like

221
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,600
one of the shapes.

222
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:50,839
I brought just a little circle,
'cause that's a pretty easy one

223
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,767
to demonstrate with.

224
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,100
And I brought a pan.

225
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,635
You don't need to prep
your pan or do anything.

226
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,700
You can just use
your little circle.

227
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,840
And then you just really you
take a little bit in your

228
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:05,700
fingers, push it down in there.

229
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:08,014
It takes a little bit of time,
but it's really pretty simple.

230
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:12,011
And then you just want to
firmly pack it in there.

231
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:17,967
And as you push it all in then
just gently kind of take

232
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,367
the little loop off.

233
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:23,000
You can see how it turns out. Turns out like that.

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,033
And when it hardens
up, it stays that way.

235
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,600
And it's really nice
you can pack them up.

236
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:28,373
You can stack them together
and wrap them up if you'd like.

237
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:36,633
So, let me do
another one of those.

238
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:38,166
You could maybe
alternate flavors.

239
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,000
Do one kind of crisp and then
do a different kind

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,008
of flavored crisp.

241
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:48,942
Alright, so I packed
that in there.

242
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:51,166
Wiggle it a little
bit and there we go.

243
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,934
So, I would fill up the rest of
the tray and then stick that

244
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,600
in the freezer.

245
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,013
And I'm gonna finish
working on these.

246
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:59,006
Whatever I have left I'm gonna
put in here and then

247
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:01,472
I'll come right back.

248
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,567

249
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:06,013
Okay, the chocolate,
peanut butter,

250
00:12:07,003 --> 00:12:09,869
protein crisp has been in
the freezer for about an hour,

251
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,367
so we're gonna go take that out.

252
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,640
They look great.

253
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:19,767
I took out the ones
that we cut into shapes.

254
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:23,300
So, now they're nice and
frozen and solid, so.

255
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:26,010
If you are making this and
you actually keep it in

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,002
one big dish, it makes about
a serving of eighteen.

257
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:33,935
For a single serving of these
you're looking at 153 calories,

258
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:38,300
about 7 grams of fat,
21.5 grams of carbohydrates,

259
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:40,537
and about 5.6 grams of protein.

260
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,700
So, I hope you like them.

261
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:44,012
I hope you get creative and have
a little bit of fun with it.
