1
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:15,541
i'm natalie Haasan and I'm here nobody
will not come kitchen today showing you

2
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,360
how to me for my favorite fighters
rescue

3
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:22,104
and I call it def by garlic roasted
asparagus and it's really good side is

4
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,017
sick overtaken or tilapia

5
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:28,766
he and it even works great as leftovers
I put it in a ziploc bag in you that the

6
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:28,985
next day

7
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,940
for today's recipe this is a pretty
simple recipe there really is a few

8
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:32,160
ingredients

9
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,037
in I have everything here we are going
to use fresh

10
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:39,170
asparagus and news about one count of
asparagus the usually come in bundles

11
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:40,866
like this

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,920
and some asparagus is little bit more
thin and some asparagus is a little bit

13
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:45,157
thicker

14
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:50,666
and it doesn't really matter you can use
either for any is fresh garlic

15
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,188
Inc some growth does come pre minutes
but I prefer the fresh for like

16
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:57,350
I think me first PT little bit better so
organized by the

17
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:02,224
garlic clove like this and then we are
going to use garlic powder

18
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:05,551
and just make sure that you get the
garlic powder and not the garlic salt

19
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,940
they look real somewhere they come in
the same sizeof container

20
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:11,187
but the garlic father quite a bit if l
added to it in the ground cutters just

21
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:17,089
straight garlic and then we are going to
use extra virgin olive oil

22
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:21,161
and risking you want people to know that
some just a little bit and then

23
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:25,117
Sun paper and I have fresh ground pepper
but you could if you don't have the

24
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:28,052
fresh ground just regular black pepper
will work as well

25
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:32,103
and then we're going to take everything
on a cookie sheet in line with aluminum

26
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:33,056
foil

27
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:37,255
and i really wanna head in preheated the
oven to 400 degrees so the first thing

28
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,838
your gonna do is line a cookie sheet
with aluminum foil

29
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:47,340
and this just makes for easier cleanup

30
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:50,078
so that way when you're done all you
have to do is take your woman file out

31
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:57,078
thrown in the trash in its really easy
to clean up swimmers can set this aside

32
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,060
first we just take our bench for spare
guess

33
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:10,094
take off the rubber bands and then

34
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:17,094
strength of make sure that gets nice and
rinsed

35
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:23,079
and then when I view as I like to keep
the spare guess

36
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,143
still in punt formation and you want to
cut off the bottom

37
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:31,055
about into the stock and because the
bottom-up stock is really tough

38
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:34,055
and it it doesn't he's got its not fund
issue so

39
00:02:34,055 --> 00:02:37,146
what I view as I just take a kitchen
knife and I just cut all at once thats

40
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:39,048
really fast and easy

41
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:44,070
of he's cut off the bottom love the

42
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:48,046
asparagus and then what you gonna do is
evenly distribute the asparagus

43
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:56,009
over the could be /c men except is
mincing the garlic so

44
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:01,121
garlic when it comes to clothes has an
outer shell kinda like an anion

45
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:08,022
and so what I usually do is just cut the
end of 2003 easier to peel

46
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,023
and then there's some stuff I just throw
that away

47
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:15,078
and then there's if you can see inside
there's a lot of little

48
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:18,143
water call girl close see just take out

49
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,134
this recipe calls for anywhere from four
to six garlic cloves it just depends on

50
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,063
how much curly Q like

51
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:27,136
I usually I like a lot acrylic so I air
on the fighter

52
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,123
sex but if you don't like I like as much
or as strong

53
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:36,091
thing you could do stand for and and
nothing to if you don't like garlic

54
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:41,154
unit actually make this recipe even
without the girl I can just use on paper

55
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:45,098
no it's not it's pretty are

56
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:48,101
sums gonna 5 and we have six garlic
cloves here

57
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,032
now they still have kinda outer paper
resell

58
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:56,057
on them and so you take that off so what
you do is you just put the garlic clove

59
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:57,072
far you're cutting board

60
00:03:57,072 --> 00:04:00,141
take a knife has kinda wider flat edge

61
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,045
you just like this we just headed

62
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:08,051
when it does the concussions your garlic
salt makes a really easy

63
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,054
to pull open actually found out the
phone has

64
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:14,145
to close and find a bit so I unity again

65
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:18,131
and then it makes it really easy just a
few of the

66
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:23,950
out urself so I'm just gonna do this for
all six

67
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,313
I really like I need a fair guess a lot

68
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,780
I really like eating asparagus and one
thing a lot of people don't know is that

69
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:37,217
asparagus is actually really high in
Foley

70
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,750
and a lot of pregnant women are
recommended to take folic acid

71
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:45,150
which is the supplemental form fully and
suspect this is really good for pregnant

72
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:46,634
women to

73
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,155
and asparagus is also a natural diuretic
so

74
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:56,340
if you feel like you're holding on to
some water waiter for fun kinda bloated

75
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:59,883
sometimes even some asparagus can

76
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:07,110
help your body red itself from the water

77
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:10,380
so your hands are gonna feel kinda sick
you when you're doing this

78
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,491
that's okay that's normal

79
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,658
34

80
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,270
persons since that original club
actually was to close in Saidapet

81
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:29,022
that one of them to fine

82
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,247
man I just for all the papers that way
sometimes it fixed your hand a little

83
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,415
bit

84
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:41,034
print my fingers right so we're gonna
miss the garlic really finally and I'm

85
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:43,275
just gonna do that with a knife

86
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,030
we already took the outer shell of the
people report

87
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:50,542
and I just put my hand on the top and
the kinda fun shit together

88
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:55,625
and I just

89
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,182
min fit like this they just keep
pressure on the top of the knife

90
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:05,666
and I just kind of keep going back and
forth and then what I do

91
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,810
isn't it back together in just keep

92
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,626
keep me in things like that

93
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:17,310
in you just want really pretty finely
minced because you don't want

94
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:24,031
anybody to take a big old chunk a garlic
they might not appreciate you for a

95
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:29,348
this is looking pretty good

96
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,826
I would say that if about is finely
minced easy one

97
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:38,196
so I'm going to Prince William

98
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:45,529
missed and then I'm gonna set this aside
for second

99
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:50,523
and then we're gonna do is put olive oil
on

100
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,318
so i think is one tablespoon of olive
oil now this

101
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,678
recipe makes 4 servings and so each

102
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,763
serving is going to have less than a
teaspoon of olive oil

103
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,182
so I do I want to measure it out because
sometimes

104
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,444
I have a tendency to use too much olive
oil so I just like to measure now that

105
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,983
we know I'm just using a tablespoon

106
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,455
and I just slowly drizzle it over

107
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,154
just like this

108
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,290
and then i'll do is i'll take either
spatula or even just measuring spoon and

109
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,840
I'll just sort of go like this

110
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:28,493
tooth just to

111
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,650
texture that were olive oil doesn't

112
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:35,264
get wasted on the bottom of the cookie
sheet

113
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,858
and then it its overall the affair

114
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:43,460
so then we're gonna do is we're going to
take for garlic powder

115
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,645
so if you have thicker stocks you may
not be quite as much

116
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,078
garlic powder term

117
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:53,770
but if you have more stocks you might
need a little bit more if senator stocks

118
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:57,656
so I just sprinkle this is one teaspoon

119
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,990
and that even cover half its I'm gonna
do it again three teaspoons Eagles 1

120
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,578
tablespoon

121
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,532
cell scan keep sprinkling it looks like
an ease the full table stand for this

122
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,108
because remember this is called death by
Karl Eikenberry if

123
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,193
free pretty heavy on your garlic if you
don't like I like again

124
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:20,229
you can use lighter garlic or even know
garlic is the salt pepper

125
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,430
and then I I'm many some fresh ground
pepper

126
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:26,402
and this I just kinda I felt like a
family is about a teaspoon maybe

127
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,740
teaspoons

128
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:32,118
if you don't have the fresh ground its
regular black performer

129
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:38,497
if you want to add some salt you can buy
I usually just don't add extra salt

130
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,702
and then what I'm going to do is take my
ninth Lincoln SQ

131
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,290
the garlic onto the knife and then just
evenly distribute this over the

132
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,035
asparagus

133
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:52,082
so I just take my finger in a just like
this

134
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:55,100
now if you're the eap raw garlic clove

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,002
you're either prolly water up in your
mouth but really start to burn

136
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:02,090
because it's really spicy but when your
upset like we're going to

137
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:05,035
on 400 degrees critic's summer the
spiciness

138
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:09,019
add the garlic and it makes it have more

139
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:12,073
the garlic flavor that reissue

140
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:16,073
so that's it I'm gonna do is rinsed my
hands and insects and other than at 400

141
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,087
degrees

142
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:20,141
and I'm gonna cook it for 15 to 20
minutes so what I'm going to do is put

143
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:21,136
this in Irvine

144
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:26,067
set the timer for 10 minutes at 10
minutes and take a spatula in just gonna

145
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,138
rotate the the asparagus a little bit

146
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:33,040
to make sure that once I doesn't get for
a crispy

147
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:36,026
and then I'm gonna put it back in the
oven anywhere from five to ten minutes

148
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:39,099
and if it starts to look to brown then
applied at five minutes usually I cook

149
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:42,166
it for the full 20 min

150
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:47,082
rock ok alright so we just take the S
various other

151
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:50,153
lovin at 10 minutes we take this very
guess just wrote it make sure wasn't

152
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:51,135
burning

153
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:55,090
and then at fifteen minutes we checked
again and what I like to look for is to

154
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,017
make sure that the

155
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:59,177
girl xr6 can turn brown a little bit an
actual 15 minutes

156
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:03,174
ours looks good so you can cook at 15
and up to 20 minutes so we take our

157
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:07,149
a fifteen-minute and than what I do

158
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:13,072
is a test is my satchel and

159
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:20,072
the asparagus fun to play

160
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,105
asparagus is a little bit senator which
is probably why we were able to take out

161
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,061
50 minutes to

162
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:30,062
there's burgers is a little bit thicker
you probably want to go closer towards

163
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,136
20-minute mark

164
00:10:32,036 --> 00:10:36,058

super easy idea of

165
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:40,075
for aluminum foil third in the trash

166
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:43,090

try it
