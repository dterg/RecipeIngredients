00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,767
Hi, I'm Jamie Eason,
and I'm in

3
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,100
the bodybuilding.com
kitchen today,

4
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,005
and I'm excited 'cause I'm
gonna show you how to make my

5
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,972
Honey Almond Protein Crisps.

6
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:29,900
I've showed you guys how to
make chocolate protein bars,

7
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,175
lemon protein bars,
carrot cake.

8
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,400
They're all kind
of, like, cakey,

9
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,006
so I wanted something with
a little bit of crunch,

10
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:39,011
and this is super, super simple
and tastes really, really good.

11
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,668
So let's get started.

12
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:45,767
For this recipe we're gonna need
3 cups of crispy brown rice.

13
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:48,166
We're gonna need
1 cup of whole oats.

14
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,400
We're gonna also need
a scoop of vanilla protein,

15
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:53,237
whichever kind you like.

16
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:57,300
We'll also need a fourth of
a cup of chopped almonds.

17
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,007
You can either just use whole
almonds and break 'em up

18
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,440
yourself, or you can buy the
chopped almonds at the store.

19
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,467
And then for our
wet ingredients,

20
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,000
we're gonna do almond butter.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're gonna have honey,
and this isn't actually wet,

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,834
but it's gonna go in
the wet ingredients.

23
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,000
That's our xylitol
brown sugar blend.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,008
This recipe is super easy,
and it comes together

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,013
really, really quickly.

26
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,869
All you're gonna need is
basically a large bowl so you

27
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:23,200
can dump all the ingredients in,
and we need a smaller bowl

28
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:26,005
so that we can actually just
microwave to heat it up just

29
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,372
a little bit, so that it's
easier to actually mix

30
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,433
into our dry ingredients.

31
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:32,700
And once you do that,
it's pretty much done,

32
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,640
and we stick it in the freezer.

33
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,340
No baking at all, and you can
eat it in about 30 minutes.

34
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:41,200
To begin with, we've added
already 3 cups of

35
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,669
the crispy brown rice.

36
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:45,100
Now, you can hopefully
find this at one of your

37
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,010
local grocery stores.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,033
I've seen it at Whole Foods almost every time.

39
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,266
The reason I like
this, it's gluten free.

40
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:53,000
It's really got very
few ingredients.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,133
It does have some
natural sugar in it,

42
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:58,135
but it's from evaporated cane
juice and it's organic molasses.

43
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,342
So it's only got 2 grams
of sugar per serving,

44
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:04,200
which is 3/4ths of a cup,
and we've got 3 cups in here,

45
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,435
so you're looking at less than
5 grams of sugar for the entire

46
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,641
batch, and you're not supposed
to eat the entire batch.

47
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:12,667
So 3 cups go in the bowl,

48
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,800
and then we've got
1 cup of whole oats...

49
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,010
So we're gonna
dump that on top.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,367
And then we're gonna
add a fourth of a scoop

51
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,367
of crushed almonds.

52
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:25,200
So you can actually do your own
if you'd like and just use your

53
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:28,769
trusty rolling pin and, you
know, beat 'em down that way.

54
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:31,500
Or you can buy 'em already
chopped at the store,

55
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,006
which is what we have...

56
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,739
So I'm gonna add
a fourth of a cup.

57
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,734
And I kind of
sprinkle it around,

58
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:40,266
because we don't want to
actually mix it up too much

59
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:42,433
until we have the rest
of our ingredients ready.

60
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,767
And the last ingredient
for our dry ingredients is

61
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:48,767
one scoop of protein...
So I'm putting that in.

62
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,600
And a lot of you
guys always ask me,

63
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,839
"What kind of protein do I use?"

64
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,441
Whatever kind of
protein you like.

65
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,767
I just like something that's
got a good vanilla flavor 'cause

66
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,166
it's usually a good
base for everything.

67
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,800
And I always look for the
fewer ingredients, the better,

68
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:02,015
but whichever one you like.

69
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,771
Some people like it
with added aminos,

70
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:08,567
and all kinds of extra little
things so that they can get,

71
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:12,066
you know, added nutrition in one
little easy scoop, so all right.

72
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,967
I'm just gonna give
it a gentle shake.

73
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:17,100
Don't mix it up yet, because
it'll all settle to the bottom.

74
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,368
Set that aside.

75
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:22,266
And now I'm gonna start
with my wet ingredients.

76
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:25,467
So we are gonna start
with almond butter.

77
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,470
Now, when you buy this
stuff at the store,

78
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,774
make sure that you're getting
the one that is just almonds

79
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,600
and salt, or just almonds.

80
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:35,012
Don't get anything that
has, like, added oils.

81
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:39,569
As you can see, there's
a ton of oil already on top.

82
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:41,834
I like to pour off
just a little bit.

83
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,835
Don't pour it all off, though,
because you'll have a really

84
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,200
hard time mixing it up
all the way to the bottom.

85
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:52,002
So I'm gonna mix it up just
a little bit...

86
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,235
and once I get that going,

87
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:59,767
we are gonna need
three-fourths of a cup of this.

88
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:02,300
So I like to use my
one-fourth scoop.

89
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:04,136
I feel like it's a little
bit more manageable,

90
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:10,700
so I'll just pour that in...
and we'll do that three times.

91
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,774
So I'll get that going.

92
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:18,471
I have my little rubber spatula
to get it out...

93
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,066
I need three.

94
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:24,700
And now you can--one of the best
parts of this recipe is that

95
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:27,274
it's really whatever
you want to put in it,

96
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,000
so if you wanted to use, you
know, peanut butter or tahini,

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,003
which is crushed sesame seeds,
or any kind of nut butters

98
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,370
that you like, really.

99
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:40,533
You can use anything, and that
goes for the nuts that you

100
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:41,867
choose as well.

101
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,200
You can choose
whatever you wanted.

102
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:44,335
So one more.

103
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,934
And as you can see, this
is a lot of healthy fats.

104
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:49,600
You're forewarned at this point
that this is not something you

105
00:04:49,006 --> 00:04:51,939
need every single day,
but it's a great snack.

106
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:55,767
And we have actually an event
tomorrow where we'll be running

107
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:59,700
and burning a lot of calories,
so this would be great for that,

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,674
because it's great for energy.

109
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,372
All right.

110
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,200
And it's being
a little stubborn,

111
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:08,005
but I think we
got it all.

112
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:11,638
Okay.
So that goes in.

113
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,367
So we've got our
three-fourths of a cup.

114
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,368
And then we're gonna
need 2 cups of honey.

115
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:22,100
And honey, of course, will
still spike your blood sugar,

116
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,868
but honey is so good for you.

117
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:26,266
It's loaded with antioxidants.

118
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:30,800
There's all sorts of benefits to
it...so we're gonna add that in.

119
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:33,042
Again, this isn't for
everyday consumption,

120
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,166
but it's gonna be
an awesome treat.

121
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,834
It tastes
unbelievable, actually,

122
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,000
for so few ingredients.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,033
So we'll get that in,
and one more...

124
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,934
There we go.

125
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:50,943
And actually, honey is kind of
fun, too, because at the store,

126
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:54,300
you'll find, like, all
different kinds of varieties.

127
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,008
You might find one that's,
like, lavender flavored.

128
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:58,341
I got one that was
rose flavored once.

129
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,137
Not so much.

130
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,538
I really felt like I was chewing
on the lawn or something.

131
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,900
Not good, so all right.

132
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:05,013
We got that.

133
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:10,009
And then to this, I'm gonna add
a half a cup of xylitol

134
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,018
brown sugar blend.

135
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,374
You don't have to use
this if you don't want to,

136
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,467
because you're fine with
that amount of honey.

137
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:20,500
This will kind of kick up
the intensity a little bit

138
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,013
and make it a little sweeter.

139
00:06:22,003 --> 00:06:24,004
I think it really
adds a lot to it.

140
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:27,538
And it does add some
calories, but unlike sugar,

141
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,200
which is like 3.7 or
something like that for sugar,

142
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,269
this is only 2-point-something.

143
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:36,470
So it's less, and actually,
it's approved for diabetics,

144
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:38,400
because it spikes
your blood sugar less.

145
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:40,012
So we're gonna throw that in
there...but I do want to show

146
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,835
you this one other alternative.

147
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,767
Some of you may or may not
be familiar with sucanat.

148
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:48,934
It's actually a brown
sugar substitute as well.

149
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:51,233
If you taste it,
it's really granular,

150
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:54,734
but it does have a little bit
of a hint of a molasses flavor

151
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:57,767
added to it without
extra sugar or anything.

152
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,934
So this is definitely
an option for you.

153
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:02,500
So once we've put
this in the bowl,

154
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,571
I'm gonna put it in
the microwave...

155
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,166
[beeping sound]

156
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,734
And we're just gonna
do 30-second intervals

157
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,066
is all we need.

158
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,066
And I'm gonna move
this back over here,

159
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,500
'cause we're gonna need it
to start mixing this together.

160
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:25,007
[beeping sound]

161
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,800
Sometimes it just takes one.

162
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,012
Sometimes it takes
a little longer.

163
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:35,010
I'm gonna actually go to
the bigger spatula now.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,734
Actually, that heated it
up pretty well...

165
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:45,400
Mix it all together...

166
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,071
and you really,
you're just heating it just

167
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,133
enough just so that it'll
spread easily inside here.

168
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,138
I think that's
actually pretty good.

169
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,700
If you needed to, you could
do another 30 seconds

170
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,014
in the microwave.

171
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:59,571
So I'm gonna go ahead
and pour that in.

172
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,972
You want to kind of spread it out a little bit

173
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,633
and get all of it out.

174
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,166
It's gonna seem like there's
really not enough to kind of go

175
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,367
around at first, but you just
kind of have to really

176
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,700
work it in.

177
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:15,141
So now I can start
working it together.

178
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,567
I like to kind of use this
little fold-over technique...

179
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:24,400
so it doesn't stick to my
spatula...All right.

180
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,013
So then you kind of start
chopping into it.

181
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:33,336
Now, you could actually add
dried fruits if you wanted to,

182
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,637
if this was for your kids.

183
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:37,767
You know, I know a lot of us
stay away from dried fruits,

184
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,934
but you could do all
kinds of nuts, actually.

185
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,667
Walnuts.

186
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:45,667
You could do peanuts,
whatever you'd like.

187
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,000
All right.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,367
I think we're
looking pretty good.

189
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:51,367
I see a few dry spots, but I
think I can fix that when it

190
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,033
put it into the bowl.

191
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,800
So I want to use
a 9 x 13 Pyrex dish.

192
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:58,841
You can use whichever
dish you'd like.

193
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,367
I just find that works well
because I don't need to spray it

194
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,700
or anything.

195
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,012
There's enough healthy fats in
here that you don't have to add

196
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:08,002
any nonstick sprays
or anything like that.

197
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:09,369
All right.

198
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:15,800
I'm gonna grab my dish
and pour this in...

199
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,336
All right.

200
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,633
And you kind of get it
started--I'll move that so

201
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:28,641
you can see.

202
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:33,367
Kind of get it started
with your spatula...

203
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,934
and then I like to finish it with my fingers.

204
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,700
I think it's easier to really
get it pushed down in there.

205
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:46,340
So wet your fingers just
a little bit...so it doesn't

206
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:52,034
stick, and just start really
pushing it down...

207
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,900
I could put the towel down underneath this.

208
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,375
It wouldn't be so noisy.

209
00:09:56,266 --> 00:10:01,900
So I'm just really pushing
it in good...and that's it.

210
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,018
And just so you know, one of
my favorite things, actually,

211
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:07,017
is you can use the same
technique and actually use

212
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,015
cookie cutters,
which is kind of fun,

213
00:10:10,005 --> 00:10:12,239
and make like little shapes
and stuff for the kids.

214
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,700
And now I'm just gonna put this
in the freezer and then in about

215
00:10:15,007 --> 00:10:17,740
an hour to check on it...

216
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,800
All right.

217
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:21,013
It's been about an hour, so I'm
gonna go ahead and get

218
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:26,336
the Honey Almond Protein Crisps
out of the freezer.

219
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,000
All right.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,367
It is definitely cold.

221
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:31,700
It's pretty hard.

222
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:34,774
So you can either at this
point cut it into squares

223
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,233
and sometimes, I don't even like
to go to all that trouble,

224
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,066
so I just break pieces off.

225
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,600
I recommend you store it
actually in the freezer,

226
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,140
because it'll keep
the texture nice and hard,

227
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,967
and it doesn't get
too hard to bite into.

228
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,800
But if you cut it
into 18 squares,

229
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:52,017
each one is about 154 calories,
about 8 grams, all of good fat,

230
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:56,141
21 grams of carbs,
and about 4 grams of protein.

231
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,767
So I guarantee you
will like this.

232
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,774
It's really good stuff, and I
hope you will come back

233
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,834
next time whenever I'm
making something new.
