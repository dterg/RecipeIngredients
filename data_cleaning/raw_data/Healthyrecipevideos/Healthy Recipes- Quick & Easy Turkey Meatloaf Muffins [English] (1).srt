1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:07,013
but ok

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,010
you

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:16,019
I'm do

4
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:23,092
hi and Amy and I'm inviting really not
come today to show you how I make my

5
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:31,001
turkey meatloaf muffins

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,117
any large offer this got a lot to make
set

7
00:00:42,017 --> 00:00:45,051
okay but the nice thing is just one big
ball for everything

8
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:48,054
can the first ingredient for the needy
is cat

9
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,143
a quick cooking oats dozen

10
00:00:52,043 --> 00:00:56,043
many that all these ingredients that you
mix in with it

11
00:00:56,043 --> 00:01:00,110
if that 2 tablespoons of garlic now you
can use the patter

12
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:05,054
version or you can use and the minced
version ass a way

13
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:09,140
got over here here's the minced garlic

14
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,068
now this one seems to be okay if you
read the ingredients this is Carly water

15
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,056
is a spa spark acid

16
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:18,121
and no preservatives this is OK could
probably use this as an option

17
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:24,029
and that someone be really careful read
the the label they actually have oil and

18
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:28,046
it won't be no prominent won't say on
the top so you gotta really check out

19
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,205
that is ingredients

20
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:33,880
this is actually rare to be Justin
waters that's an option to you that we

21
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:33,171
use the powder

22
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:39,099
since just get that way k then we've got
high 1 teaspoon salt

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,100
cactus teaspoons pepper

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,031
black pepper we've also got

25
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:52,053
teaspoons a a dry mustard just right
yellow plastic

26
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:55,124
and sometimes if you're looking for
trailer mustard and some people

27
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:59,026
will not be able to find it your
standard like dark

28
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:02,111
like this one you will have to find its
whateva box

29
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:06,011
looks a little bit more like pepper but
it's a start oxo

30
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,380
I've noticed it's hard to find sometimes
and that's why

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,630
and then we've got 1 teaspoon as

32
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:15,148
I'm sorry this happened he said have
Kumon communism

33
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:20,837
a really smoky spice Chile get free a
lot the spices rent accidents so they

34
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,560
really get to you if you're not using a
lot of spices in it

35
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:29,072
he said start doing so and then we also
have a half teaspoon

36
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:32,110
I have time time is used a lot

37
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:33,009
in

38
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,108
all traditions ready you're making
chicken turkey year

39
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,160
and then our last ingredient

40
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:45,021
is the one that makes the whole dish so
this is not the easiest to find so

41
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:48,110
tonight take a little while but its very
well worth it

42
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,018
this 2 teaspoons if it's holy pepper
seasoning

43
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:56,029
I'm serious see find it here's

44
00:02:56,047 --> 00:03:00,095
what it looks like so hopefully you'll
be able to find and it does add some see

45
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,188
so be careful if you're not be on hot
things

46
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:06,130
the only add teeth in half or something
like that but

47
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:12,006
I really think it without it there lil
one Plan C definitely want to see

48
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:16,037
said that's it's so I'm skinnies my
fingers in kinda get all

49
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:20,144
perforated Spath this whole recipe is
pretty much

50
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:25,062
about using your hands sound 3

51
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:28,096
tell it's pretty good on before I really
get messy

52
00:03:28,096 --> 00:03:31,105
come in and take this off pesticide

53
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:37,087
alright the next thing we need is going
to be chopped onions and chopped celery

54
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:40,185
now this is very convenient to just come
in a package in your produce section

55
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:45,140
I'm all about quick and easy so this is
what I'm gonna do I hate of indians

56
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:53,004
cell nah and if you were to chop it

57
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,098
I hear what can I wanted to you I'm
above everything so

58
00:03:58,043 --> 00:04:02,058
quite a bit you really can't overdo the
vegetables in a few nice and a celery

59
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:05,079
can use red peppers green peppers
anything you want

60
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,123
and that celery in enhancing to work
really well finished

61
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:12,120
but the more veggies you add the more
moisture there's going to be in your day

62
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:17,026
she stuff so overdo the veggies instead

63
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:20,082
under help Texas I'm

64
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:23,087
frighten the next thing you're gonna
need

65
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:28,169
is me crappy service here for this
recipe you can

66
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,071
either use I'm extra lean ground turkey

67
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:35,097
are you can use extra lean ground
chicken breast army

68
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,085
either one will work really well
actually even be four work to yourself

69
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:45,130
and open

70
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:49,091
something and I'm using probably I would
say this is about time

71
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:53,097
I have high tops you pound me

72
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:58,098
something and it doesn't have to be
exact that's the great thing about this

73
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,069
restful

74
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,113
as you can and do it all the taste and
just dump it all and

75
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:06,088
seem to get so then the next thing you
need to add some moisture

76
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:11,165
is good three egg whites if you're not
concerned about adding any

77
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:15,081
added fat you can actually do a whole
egg in their bit for this

78
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:22,081
purpose for going to just used a rights
1

79
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:32,180
eg to you

80
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:37,039
eg three

81
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:41,012
now before I really get me in there and
get dirty

82
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:44,801
I'm gonna make sure first I have my
mustn't hand

83
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,007
pets and I've artie said the event

84
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:53,330
375 degrees so make sure you preheat
it's ready to go before you and

85
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,118
millions of

86
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,024
alright so we're gonna prep this because

87
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:04,717
I don't have to stop in the middle is
keeping fingers do it so I'm going to

88
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:05,478
use

89
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,040
I'm my no lo or olive oil spray

90
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,391
and this is 12 muffin tins should make
about 12

91
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,039
and sometimes it goes all over it just
depends on how big or small I make them

92
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:28,019
K nice frame good to make sure they
don't stay

93
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,034
and save my pain

94
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:34,122
because I hate when they get gross I
always always always white

95
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:38,119
excess of top cuz they will get pretty
gritty

96
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,022
if you start making these a lot which is
what I do because

97
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:45,093
I always have these on hand in mine for
trade or just ready to go

98
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:48,142
cash to keep this recipe completely
frozen

99
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,500
in your in your freezer just take them
out one at a time in my career in front

100
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:57,414
see alright so that's really gonna set
that aside

101
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,956
bring this back in get busy South

102
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,407
take any jury of this

103
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,930
quite very

104
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:11,127
starting to look pretty grody which is
exactly what we want

105
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:16,109
need don't wanna over makes me

106
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,083
too too much and you doing to make sure
you get all the spices incorporated

107
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,146
and left it up to you know that stuff
outta there and

108
00:07:25,046 --> 00:07:29,805
if you over makes me tho it tends to get
a little more tasks so

109
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,248
don't go crazy skit

110
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:37,870
all in and the nice thing about

111
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:41,168
this dish to you is that the muffin tins
are what keep it

112
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:47,117
in its a serving size so it's all nice
and portable that way and it's got

113
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,590
your car and your protein are next in
line now is a low amount of carbs so

114
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:56,388
you could still eat them into PDA kid
and at issue rice cakes or something to

115
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:57,340
them

116
00:07:57,034 --> 00:08:00,112
return my foot that I'm still seeing
spices some makin sure

117
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:04,094
re: don't over mix of stuff there

118
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:07,130
all right now we're gonna put them
enormous in 10

119
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:13,019
and I think he'd do about a racquetball
size

120
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:17,305
see that might be a little larger than a
racquetball size but

121
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,735
that we'll see how that works and
sometimes I get all the way through and

122
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,610
have to steal a little from the other
one

123
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:30,061
kinda making me even now can they don't
have to be perfect fit

124
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:40,396
another thing is and that that the fact
that they're in a mass in 10 this is

125
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,050
essentially just the meatloaf

126
00:08:42,005 --> 00:08:46,022
and the differences most me loves have
like a catch it face kind

127
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:50,301
in the weather sketch efforts made a
saucer something inside oven

128
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:53,592
I'm with Calif that out and just put the
eggs in a lot of

129
00:08:54,429 --> 00:09:00,490
veggies in there so they're not quite as
moist you can if you if you want to

130
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:03,688
you can actually do not call it
something push it down in the middle

131
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,154
and put like a catch up for a barbecue
sauce or something in the you want to

132
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:12,040
they get a little slimy in a little bit
messy to take with you so

133
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:17,036
only do that when you play any my at
home I think hey we're doing good

134
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:21,545
now looking like an overdoing it yet but
and

135
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:25,890
other PDF having them in a muffin tin
not only is that it's the right portion

136
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:26,480
but

137
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:29,317
dead the moisture from the veggies

138
00:09:29,749 --> 00:09:33,220
stays confined in a little tense so its
debt

139
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:36,241
tends to keep the me from getting overly
dry cuz

140
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:39,740
you action ground turkey has no fact
really so

141
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:46,074
really Kenneth just its overcome pretty
easily

142
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:51,089
go exciting stuff like to do this

143
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:55,104
which kate looks like I actually

144
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:59,017
maybe have I can make maybe make them a
little bit figure self

145
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:03,035
I'm in class 1 at a little bit to hear

146
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,106
now if you were to cookies and measure
them now

147
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:12,043
and they would usually be about two and
a half ounces each

148
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:16,098
so that will come to you you know AppID
serving size I care

149
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:20,147
and mayo Miami Heat's I'm maybe

150
