00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:04,378
the

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:05,460
that

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,121
%uh

4
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,069
%uh %uh

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,132
%uh mom

6
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:15,046
%uh

7
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:17,115
are

8
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:21,714
hi I'm same even in for gay and the
bottling up counting

9
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:24,915
excited to show you how tiny cinnamon
swirl affecting back

10
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,210
it's where my favorite things I can use
as a snack and meal

11
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:32,043
because it's got your healthy carbs and
a healthy protein

12
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:35,052
so let's get started first thing you're
gonna want to do is preheat your oven to

13
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,442
350 degrees

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,210
the next thing I did was I got Mike and
ready this is

15
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:45,065
after eight by eight inspire Xth I just
a light little non-stick spray and you

16
00:00:45,065 --> 00:00:46,114
can set that aside

17
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:50,090
and then I got all my ingredients
together and for this I want a large

18
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:50,064
bowl

19
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:53,119
for my dry ingredients and a small table
for my wedding gradients

20
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:58,075
so the first ingredient I'm using is ok
flower in a supermarket this is what

21
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:59,224
helps lower looks like

22
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,904
now I'm often asked if this is
gluten-free and ot

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,860
oats typically are gluten-free but one
thing to note is that unless it doesn't

24
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:11,125
indicated on the bag you never really
sure is maybe it was cross-contaminated

25
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,020
in processing

26
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:16,095
so for this one it doesn't indicate
gluten-free that for the most part oats

27
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:17,099
are but if you're concerned

28
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:21,234
be sure to look for that indication
unlabeled if you can't find

29
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,567
its new supermarket you can actually
make your down you can use a coffee

30
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:24,804
grinder

31
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,560
in just ran a little bit at a time or
you could use a blender

32
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:31,115
just make sure to know that sometimes
you can't get it as finely ground as

33
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:35,067
what's in the package seem I have to
increase the amount you're using for the

34
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:35,125
rescue

35
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:39,068
and the slides ball I've added a cap and
a half though far

36
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:42,437
and to that I'm gonna add as an hour
away protein

37
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,540
now you can use whichever one you
practice to skips in here make sure to

38
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:47,063
know that

39
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,850
that different flavors and from the
different manufactures will make them

40
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:50,094
taste different me

41
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:54,136
so I want to use one that has as few
ingredients and it is possible the

42
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:55,118
cleaner the better

43
00:01:56,018 --> 00:02:00,497
summit damn fat and smile flower and
then said that

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,687
I'm gonna at it myself now if you use a
letting agent like baking soda or baking

45
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:05,840
powder

46
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:11,162
he usually need salt because that makes
it react add those in

47
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:16,091
and then to this dry ingredient batter I
mean actually

48
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:20,183
add 1/4 cup stevia

49
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,172
this is what's TVL looks like at the
supermarket

50
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:27,129
i'm steve is a great national sweetener
because it's no calorie

51
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:33,258
has no car I don't typically use just
stevia around two sweet my recipes

52
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,577
because it can be kinda better

53
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,101
there's different brands st. Viator
stevia and there's another raincoat

54
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,030
trivia

55
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:42,015
trivia is a great option to that is
typically more expensive

56
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:45,078
there's two sides to the stevia plant
this one tends to be slightly more

57
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:45,757
better

58
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:51,110
it is cheaper and trivia usually see in
packets are in a little tiny tent for

59
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:51,070
baking

60
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,096
forgoing the cheap route today that's it
for dry ingredients we do have these two

61
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:58,087
other ingredients used the extra special
ones that just make it

62
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:01,426
actually ami dorgan eases later
something to eat this aside

63
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,400
to get me my list just like the CEP
really well

64
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:11,036
let's try get that baking powder on top
rated sometimes if you don't want fake

65
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:17,129
evenly think that skin Somerset that's
what I and get this smaller bowl ready

66
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:19,118
for my wedding the ants

67
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:23,034
for the wet ingredients bringing me to
egg whites

68
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:26,047
you can see he's a whole egg if your
knees a whole egg but

69
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:30,084
I prefer to minimize the fat and
payments and USPS I can do that

70
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:36,181
my second eg if he ever drop

71
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:40,162
be ok in there indices the same shell is
the shit out it comes right out

72
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:44,801
so dropped funny and shoe the eggs

73
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,930
I'm gonna had one jar as ABC applesauce

74
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:51,242
he can use regular after soft but what
are the reasons I like

75
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,590
and the baby food brand is there's
typically no additives as long as you

76
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:55,140
read the label

77
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:59,037
there's no additives and it's nice and
forcing portion controlled

78
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:02,075
so out open at get all the good stuff
off the top

79
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:08,140
can skip this out again just unsweetened
applesauce

80
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:12,063
and from the jar that works just like

81
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:15,493
that's my additional sweetener one of
them to the stevia which

82
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,867
actually will cut some that bitterness
next thing I had is gonna be my

83
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,860
yogurt and I cheese Greek yogurt because
Greek yogurt actually has less sugar

84
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:27,099
and has added protein so I only need a
half a container this

85
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,150
some rescue cats can add some moisture
to spread

86
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,092
said babysit applesauce and yogurt
actually replace the butter and oil in a

87
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:36,053
traditional recipe

88
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:39,081
saw at that and then for

89
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:42,170
a substitute for milk I'm using my and
sweetened

90
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:46,906
almond breeze now on NBC again I like
this better than say so we

91
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,680
or rights not because it has again added
protein so it's just more nutritious and

92
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,830
it's healthy fats so

93
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:59,111
at that meeting about a cat and

94
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:05,033
spot it through and ingredients Surekha
my happening around

95
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:09,036
really taste interested take

96
00:05:09,063 --> 00:05:13,077
really get again one of my favorite you
can actually make

97
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:17,026
s and any candidate I it's like we're
gonna do we can get in a traditional

98
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,744
left and now they have mixed on the wet
ingredients and add the wet ingredients

99
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,810
to the dry ingredients

100
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:26,134
so get my large ball back now and get my
little rubber spatula so I can get

101
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:31,037
all the wet ingredients as their choice
great the ball

102
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:35,059
more moisture the vatican cannot be
icing my niece and

103
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:39,105
and stay that way not get right out so
added

104
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:47,005
the lets the dry an expat see

105
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:52,041
you want it to be. slightly runny
because it needs to poor

106
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:56,108
so easily so if it's too thick you can
always add a little bit more

107
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:01,012
%uh on in Greece or on the No whichever
renewing cheese

108
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:07,026
break that streak end always to go again
but I want to try

109
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:11,044
eggs in their so I'm now gonna set this
to the site again

110
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:14,101
because now I'm gonna start using

111
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,049
my special dry ingredients here

112
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:21,126
got my cinnamon and guess I'll atop now
that I was there other

113
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:25,033
braniff sweetener that I like to use for
the other type a sweet because

114
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:29,105
this one and even now it's no calorie
actually has carbs

115
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,051
but it is far less bitter then something
like Steve yes I find whenever is both

116
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:36,610
it kinda bounces out that bitterness

117
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,069
summit had my sentiment is out on this
is a third of the cut

118
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,097
you can use more or less I i just like
my cinnamon swirl pretty mad face we

119
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:47,149
and I mean I had it two or three
teaspoons cinnamon again however much

120
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:48,056
you like

121
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,528
I added three a really really like
center in South poor that an

122
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:59,699
mix that up really well now that's how
does tend to be a little more granular

123
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:02,000
then

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,037
I'm traditional shaker and more granular
than that

125
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:09,058
and Steve yet but I think that's good
because it actually helps sorted

126
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,060
maintain that rare

127
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:14,093
that we're trying to create interpreting
red and also I don't know if you know

128
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:14,582
that

129
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,650
and that I was actually the same 10
that's used and

130
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:21,086
fluoride toothpaste and it's actually
good for your teeth

131
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:24,145
so imagine that sure that's good for you
too

132
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,860
i think thats it's nice it makes looks
pretty good

133
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:31,168
city now a minute set these things aside

134
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:36,084
Graham I can now start putting together

135
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:39,153
desert my poor are really shallow rare

136
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:44,056
on the bottom at the pier to spread that
out

137
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:47,061
the thinner the better because if you if
you pour half the batter which

138
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:51,055
seems like that should be fine typically
you're gonna kind as

139
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,097
and miss that little cinnamon where
that's in between

140
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:58,128
spend that really wow

141
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:03,127
expert again and again depending on your
protein

142
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:06,383
the consistency if your battery might
vary a little bit

143
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,780
so now I'm gonna added my sentiments
I'll atomic share

144
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:13,557
cinnamon sugar was caught that sounds
better and it's pretty heavy

145
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:20,270
I like to actually add more then I'm
more than half

146
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:23,068
so that's covered pretty well got about
that much left

147
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:26,557
yes for the top and that's my middle
looks like

148
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,300
so than a minute for the rest the batter
on top need is can I wanna do it where

149
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:32,032
it's

150
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:39,329
you know even she here are covered in

151
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:46,047
rate that looks pretty good

152
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:50,166
some spread that out

153
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:57,589
men I'm just gonna added the rest the
cinnamon sugar on top

154
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:03,812
nice thing about this too is that it
looks really pretty and if you make it

155
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,863
actually in the left pane you can

156
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,650
and cut slices and actually use it to
make a difference tests which is pretty

157
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:11,234
good as well

158
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:15,350
summit take my knife now and to make
swirl minute drama nice

159
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:21,047
to the batter yet however you want to
scan make sure it incorporated

160
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:24,091
I just can't go back and forth a little
bit

161
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,130
now in its third in the event that
remember I P he did before

162
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:34,949
at 350 degrees

163
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:40,096
okay and 24 minutes let's text

164
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:43,185
are cinnamon protein bread

165
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:48,096
your seven depending on the temperature
they can vary and sometimes it's 24

166
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,522
minutes sometimes it might be more like
30 minutes

167
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:57,819
so let's check in see how r slept looks
pretty good

168
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,100
I think now is that I let it cool down
for about five to ten minutes before we

169
