2
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,734
I'm Natalie Hodson,
and I'm here today in

3
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,734
the bodybuilding.com kitchen,
showing you how to make

4
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:18,400
one of my favorite recipes.

5
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:20,870
It's a strawberry banana
oatmeal protein bake.

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:24,433
And I like to make this sort of
as a healthier version of

7
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:27,066
banana bread so if I'm craving
banana bread but I know it's

8
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:29,533
not very healthy for me,
I'll make this instead.

9
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,200
And it's also a really good
meal that you can make

10
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,006
on the weekends.

11
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,008
You can make it in bulk and
you can keep it in your 'fridge

12
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,013
during the week or you can also
freeze it so if you have to get

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,336
out the door really
quickly in the morning,

14
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:41,300
this is a great item you can
eat for your breakfast meal.

15
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,003
So for today's recipe, these are
the ingredients that

16
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:44,836
we're going to use.

17
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:47,300
And we have dry ingredients and
wet ingredients that we're

18
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,009
gonna mix separately.

19
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,442
So for our dry ingredients, we
have 2 cups of old-fashioned

20
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,336
oats and I prefer the
old-fashioned oats

21
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,734
to the instant oats just
because they've been

22
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,533
a little bit less processed.

23
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,467
The instant oats have
actually been flattened,

24
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:01,472
cooked and dehydrated and so
the old-fashioned oats have just

25
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,533
been rolled and they're
a little bit better for you.

26
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:07,767
And then we have 4 scoops of
vanilla whey protein powder.

27
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,773
You can use any
brand you prefer,

28
00:01:09,367 --> 00:01:11,600
just keep in mind that the
different brands will make it

29
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,973
taste slightly different.

30
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,800
We have 2 tablespoons of ground
flax seed and this is actually

31
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:20,016
optional but flax seed has--is
full of omega 3 fatty acids

32
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:25,007
and they help reduce
the LDL cholesterol,

33
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,014
the bad cholesterol, and it's
full of fiber and antioxidants

34
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,071
so it just makes the recipe
a little bit healthier.

35
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,266
And when you buy the flax seed,
it comes in a bag like this,

36
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:37,300
it's already ground, and you
usually can find that in usually

37
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:39,437
in the baking aisle of your
grocery store by the other

38
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,333
flours and things like that.

39
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,734
Then we have 1 tablespoon
of ground cinnamon.

40
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:49,200
We have 1 teaspoon
of baking powder,

41
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:51,008
a fourth of a teaspoon of salt
and that's just to help

42
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,875
the baking powder rise.

43
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:56,633
And then we have a 1/2
cup of Stevia in the Raw.

44
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:58,640
And that's what I
used for this recipe.

45
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,400
If you had Truvia or Xylitol,
you can use that as well.

46
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:05,006
And then for our
wet ingredients,

47
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:08,439
I have a 1/2 cup of unsweetened
applesauce

48
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,037
which is also 4 ounces.

49
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,442
This is the kind I got.

50
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,900
When you get your applesauce,
you just want to make sure that

51
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,242
you get one that says no sugar
added or natural applesauce and

52
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:22,000
the most important thing you can
do is read the ingredients list

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
so try to find one that the only
ingredients are apples and water

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,001
and maybe ascorbic acid and
that's just vitamin C to help

55
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,167
keep the applesauce
from turning brown.

56
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,500
And sometimes I even--what I'll
do is I get

57
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:35,439
the little Mott's containers that are for kids

58
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,433
and that way it's like
the perfect serving size

59
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,867
and I have those in
my cupboard for my son anyways

60
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,734
and I'll use those sometimes.

61
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:46,066
So that's a 1/2 a cup and
then we have 1-1/2 cups of

62
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:48,834
unsweetened vanilla almond milk.

63
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,367
And I like to use almond milk
in my recipes instead of milk

64
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,266
because it's lower in calories
and it has less sugar.

65
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,333
And this is the kind I like.

66
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,300
I like the Almond Breeze brand,
unsweetened vanilla almond milk.

67
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,537
It only has 40 calories.

68
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:03,233
Just be careful when you're
buying your almond milk because

69
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,800
some of the flavors add quite
a bit of sugar so, again,

70
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,741
just read the ingredient list
and make sure that--like,

71
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:11,867
this one has 0 grams
of sugar in it.

72
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:16,800
And then we're gonna use a
fourth of a cup of plain Greek

73
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:19,009
yogurt and this is the Greek
yogurt that we have today.

74
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:20,018
Just, again, make sure that
you're getting the non-fat plain

75
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,541
Greek yogurt.

76
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,700
Make sure you don't get one
that's vanilla flavored or any

77
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:27,011
other flavor because they're
gonna add a lot of sugar.

78
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,735
If you look at the back, it
might have anywhere from 5

79
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,633
to 8 grams of sugar and those
are the sugars that naturally

80
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,200
occur in lactose so.

81
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,004
And then we're gonna
use four egg whites.

82
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,371
I have my whole eggs here.

83
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,166
We'll crack them when
we make the recipe.

84
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,400
And I have two bananas.

85
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:48,770
We're gonna slice these really
thin and then we have four

86
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,767
or five strawberries and you
want to get big strawberries.

87
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,900
If they're kind of small then
you can go five or even six.

88
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,016
And those are all the
ingredients we're gonna use

89
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:57,011
today in our recipe.

90
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,334
All right.

91
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,834
So first what we're gonna do is
mix all of our dry ingredients

92
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:03,166
together in a bowl.

93
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,834
So you're gonna take a larger
mixing bowl and you want to put

94
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:09,066
the dry ingredients in a larger
mixing bowl because later we're

95
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:12,533
gonna mix the wet ingredients
into the dry ingredients.

96
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:16,734
So just put your wet ingredients
aside for a second and then

97
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:25,667
we're gonna mix 2 cups of oats,
4 scoops of protein powder,

98
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:30,333
our flax seed,
1 tablespoon of cinnamon,

99
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:40,012
1/2 cup of Stevia in the Raw,
1 teaspoon of baking powder

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,967
and a fourth of a teaspoon
of salt.

101
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:51,333
And then I'm gonna take my whisk
and just make sure everything

102
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,166
gets mixed together really well.

103
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,767
Sometimes I have gotten lazy and
not mixed it together very well

104
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,166
and my baking powder doesn't
evenly distribute and then when

105
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:06,433
it cooks, half of it kind
of is flatter than the rest.

106
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,439
So you just--you want to make
sure that the cinnamon taste

107
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:14,834
gets evenly distributed
and the baking powder.

108
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,000
And just until you can't
see any more, you know,

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,934
brown spots or white spots, just
until it looks nice and mixed.

110
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:21,943
So this looks pretty good.

111
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,367
So we're just gonna set this to
the side and then mix together

112
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:29,934
our wet ingredients.

113
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:33,033
And it doesn't really
matter what order.

114
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,367
We're gonna take
our almond milk.

115
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,333
Put that to the side.

116
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,800
Our Greek yogurt.

117
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:43,009
And the Greek yogurt just adds
some moisture to the recipe and

118
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,015
actually in any recipe you can
substitute Greek yogurt

119
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:52,571
or applesauce for the butter
and the oil in the recipe.

120
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:59,633
So now we're gonna put in our
applesauce and just make sure

121
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:02,637
you use a rubber spatula
to get it all out.

122
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:07,100
And then we're gonna
put in our egg whites.

123
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:08,868
Now a little trick
that I learned.

124
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:10,971
I used to just throw my egg
whites in the trash can

125
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,300
and for some reason, I
could not figure out why,

126
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:16,270
my house smelled
bad all the time.

127
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:17,576
And then one day I went to go
take out the trash

128
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,469
and it was gross.

129
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,000
I could tell egg whites--or egg
yolks were seeping through

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,834
the bottom of the trash bag.

131
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,000
And my--we've realized that it
was because I was eating so many

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,002
egg whites and I was throwing so
many egg yolks in the trash can

133
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:35,003
and so now I just throw them in
the garbage disposal so that way

134
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,736
it doesn't stink up our house.

135
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,367
I know some people who have dogs
actually let their dogs eat

136
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:44,373
the egg yolks and it's good for
their coats but we don't have

137
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:50,975
any pets so I just do
the garbage disposal.

138
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,600
There you go.

139
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:55,572
And last one.

140
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,200
You also could do the liquid
egg whites if you wanted

141
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:00,007
that come in a carton.

142
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:03,014
Just make sure you use a little
bit less than the ratio calls

143
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:08,010
for when you bake.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,066
And then I'm gonna take
my--whoops--I'm gonna take my

145
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:14,800
whisk and just mix this
all together really well.

146
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:17,016
Sometimes the egg whites can
kind of stick together a little

147
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:25,015
bit so just mix it until
it looks nice and mixed.

148
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:30,013
Then we're gonna bring over my
mixed dry ingredients and we're

149
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:39,437
just going to combine these.

150
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,800
And then stir it all together.

151
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:44,741
I have a 2-year-old and
this is his favorite part.

152
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,541
I let him usually do this while
I'm cutting up the bananas or

153
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,800
sometimes I'll let him
cut the bananas with me.

154
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:56,012
It's kind of fun to get the
kids involved with this recipe.

155
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:01,003
It's also a really healthy meal
that you could get your kids

156
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:05,003
to get some whole grains
into their diet.

157
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:06,370
All right.

158
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:09,668
So now that that's mixed,
we're gonna prepare our pan.

159
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,033
Let's move this to the side.

160
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,734
And we're just gonna
use an 8-inch pie pan.

161
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:17,467
You could use a 9-inch pie pan
as well and if you don't have

162
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:23,600
pie pans you could even just
use a square casserole dish.

163
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:27,007
And then just really
lightly spray that.

164
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,874
You don't want to use a lot of
this stuff but I just use

165
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,300
the non-stick cooking spray.

166
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:41,009
And then just take your cutting
board and we're gonna take one

167
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:46,016
of our bananas and we're just
gonna slice it really thin.

168
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:55,773
So take your knife and you just
do pretty thin slices because

169
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,934
you want enough banana slices
that you can layer the entire

170
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:05,934
bottom of the pan.

171
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:10,834
Now sometimes bananas turn color
after they've been exposed

172
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,633
to the air.

173
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,567
And so I don't always but
sometimes I've made this dish

174
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,433
before and if I let it sit in
the 'fridge for a couple of

175
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:21,433
days, it kind of turns almost
a purplish color so if that

176
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:24,435
happens to you don't be alarmed.

177
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,266
That's not--there's
nothing wrong with it.

178
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,333
It's just because the bananas,
once they get exposed to the

179
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,800
air, they can change color.

180
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:32,675
So now what I'm doing, is I'm
just taking the banana slices

181
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,934
and lining the
bottom of the pan.

182
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:40,033
And after I'm done lining this,
then we're gonna pour the batter

183
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:42,834
on top of the bananas.

184
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,400
So this way, when
you bite into it,

185
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:46,371
you have banana taste on the
bottom and then we're gonna put

186
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,433
another layer of
bananas on the top.

187
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,767
All right.

188
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,100
So this looks pretty good.

189
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,006
Now what we're gonna do is
pour the batter

190
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:55,039
on top of the bananas.

191
00:09:55,633 --> 00:10:01,166
And you just evenly
distribute it there.

192
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:05,834
It's gonna fill the pan up
all the way to the edge.

193
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:11,800
And then just
scrape out the rest.

194
00:10:11,008 --> 00:10:12,875
All right.

195
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:17,669
And then what we're going to do
is slice our second banana and

196
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,066
we're gonna do the same thing so
we're gonna put a nice layer of

197
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:26,600
bananas on the top and not only
does this make it taste good,

198
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:33,639
but it also makes
the dish really pretty.

199
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,767
So the thinner you
slice your bananas,

200
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:42,834
the more you're gonna be
able to put across the pan.

201
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,200
All right.

202
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:53,536
And this recipe makes four
servings so one serving really

203
00:10:53,734 --> 00:11:01,633
just has one egg white, a scoop
of protein powder and 1/2 a cup

204
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:04,266
of oats plus a little
bit of Greek yogurt,

205
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,767
a little bit of almond milk.

206
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:10,233
It does have half of a banana
and a little bit of spices.

207
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:17,767
So this is a really good option
for breakfast and if you are

208
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,266
kind of getting tired of just
regular old egg whites

209
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:24,200
and oatmeal.

210
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:26,269
Okay.

211
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:30,900
So I didn't distribute this
very evenly so I'm gonna try

212
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,076
and scoot some of
these bananas over.

213
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,834
That looks pretty good.

214
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:36,843
Then what I'm gonna do is take
my strawberries and again,

215
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,867
I'm gonna slice
these fairly thin.

216
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,000
And you don't have to add the
strawberries if you don't,

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,007
you know, if you
don't have them,

218
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,440
you can just do the bananas.

219
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,134
The nice thing about this recipe
is it's really versatile

220
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,400
so you really could use
any kind of fruit.

221
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:52,005
I've done this
before with peaches

222
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:53,571
and that was pretty good.

223
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,800
I've done it with blackberries.

224
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:56,975
You could do it with apples.

225
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,769
You could do it
with raspberries,

226
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:04,633
really whatever fruit's on sale
that week, you could do it with.

227
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:07,867
Raspberries would
be really good.

228
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:14,700
And then I just put the
strawberries on top like that

229
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:22,073
and I did four--I did
four strawberries or five

230
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:27,667
strawberries and just so
it looks about like that.

231
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,233
So that's it.

232
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,667
We have the oven.

233
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,133
I already preheated the
oven to 375 degrees.

234
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,567
So I'm gonna stick this in the
oven and we are going to cook it

235
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,133
for about 40 to 45 minutes.

236
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,767
Basically the top is gonna get
golden brown and you know it's

237
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:42,767
done once you put a knife
in the center and the knife

238
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:47,000
comes out clean.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,467
All right.

240
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,166
So I just took this
out of the oven.

241
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:53,233
We cooked it for 45 minutes and
I'm just gonna test it to

242
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:57,667
make sure that a knife
comes out clean.

243
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,934
It looks pretty good.

244
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:03,333
And as you can see, the top
of this is gonna be kind of a

245
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,400
golden brown color and what I'm
gonna do is let it sit here

246
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:09,008
and rest for between 5 to 10
minutes just until it cools.

247
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,641
If I tried to cut into it now,

248
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,066
it would all sort of collapse together.

249
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:16,000
So we're gonna let it cool and
set for about 5 to 10 minutes

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,001
and then after that I
will cut it into fourths.

251
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:22,067
One serving is one wedge.

252
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:31,667
So I just usually just use a
butter knife and cut through.

253
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:35,500
And then sometimes I like to
take my knife and run it along

254
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:42,372
the side just in case--just
so it doesn't stick.

255
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:44,300
Right.

256
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:49,170
Then I'm just gonna
take a serving utensil

257
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:59,233
and pull out one wedge
and there you go.

258
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:03,500
So what I might do is cut it in
half again or just eat it like

259
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,339
that so this looks really good.

260
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:11,834
I'm gonna try a bite
and see how it tastes.

261
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:18,066
It tastes really, really good.

262
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,467
I think you'll be surprised.

263
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,900
This is one of my
favorite dishes.
