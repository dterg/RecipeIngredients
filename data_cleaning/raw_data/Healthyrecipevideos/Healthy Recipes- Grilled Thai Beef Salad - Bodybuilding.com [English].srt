00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:03,792
Hi guys, Jillian Beck here.

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,333
Welcome to my kitchen.

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:10,338
Today I will be showing
you my Thai beef salad.

4
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:13,250
It takes about, probably
20 minute to assemble.

5
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:14,567
It's super easy.

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:15,867
It's great for summer.

7
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:21,083
It's getting warmer out and I
kind of tend to go with salads

8
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,167
around this time of year,
grilled proteins are excellent,

9
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,625
the fresher, the better.

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,750
So this Thai salad is amazing
because it's got tons of herbs,

11
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:34,033
a lot of favors, some grilled
steak, which is always a winner

12
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:38,500
in my book, and then a lot of
great flavors that are very

13
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,547
typical of Thai dishes.

14
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:45,167
As you may know, I do like
Asian food and flavors if you've

15
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,167
followed any of
my other recipes.

16
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,208
I just think it's a really good
way to add flavor without adding

17
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,917
a ton of calories and fat and
all that other junk that comes

18
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,333
with like a lot of
sauces and condiments

19
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:58,417
that some other
recipes call for.

20
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:02,458
So I've kind of pre-made
things here so it goes by

21
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,375
a little quicker for you guys.

22
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:06,208
I'll kind of show you what
you're going to need

23
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,292
for this recipe.

24
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:10,958
First and foremost,
you need a lean steak.

25
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,963
I typically go with sirloin.

26
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:17,583
I'll trim the fat away from it
or I'll go with a flank steak.

27
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,000
So we've grilled that
on the Foreman here.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,667
If you have an outdoor
grill, by all means use that.

29
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,958
In my apartment, we don't have a
grill yet so I either go to my

30
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,792
friends house to, you know,
grill on the barbecue

31
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:29,000
or use the Foreman.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,958
So I've gone ahead and
I've grilled it to my liking,

33
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,500
which is about medium rare.

34
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,338
So grill it to the
temperature that you prefer.

35
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:40,167
And I've sliced it so about 4
ounces sliced for one salad.

36
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:43,542
We've got our mixed greens
here, some mixed red lettuces

37
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:47,625
and green lettuces and then
we have our fresh herbs.

38
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:53,083
We've got basil, mint,
green onion and cilantro.

39
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,088
So those are the components of
the salad and I'm gonna show you

40
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:58,588
how to make the dressing and
then we'll put it all together.

41
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,792
So for the dressing what you're
going to need is fresh lime

42
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,708
juice, which I've already
gone ahead and squeezed.

43
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,250
So we have 2
tablespoons of fresh lime.

44
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:14,983
We're going to add 1 teaspoon
of low-sodium soy sauce.

45
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:19,792
So I'll go ahead
and add that right now.

46
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,583
Here we go.

47
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,375
And then we're
going to use fish sauce

48
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,833
and it's just a
typical Asian flavor.

49
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,375
You can find it in the Asian
market in most of your grocery

50
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:33,500
stores and if you can't, maybe
go to like your local Asian

51
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:37,672
market to find it, but it's
a pretty strong flavor

52
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,458
but it's good.

53
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,917
It's just a little
goes a long ways.

54
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:47,708
So we're gonna put 2--yeah, 2
teaspoons in here along with

55
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:53,833
the 1 teaspoon of soy
and then the lime juice.

56
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,000
And then we're gonna go
ahead and add lemongrass.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,075
Now you can get fresh lemongrass
from the produce aisle and slice

58
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:01,742
it and add it to the salad
along with all the other herbs.

59
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:04,875
My grocer didn't have
that so I went ahead

60
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,950
and got the lemongrass paste.

61
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:12,083
So I'll go ahead and add that
as well and we'll just do about

62
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:18,167
half a teaspoon, just a
really small squeeze of that.

63
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:22,172
And usually with Asian dressings
and what not, they--you need to

64
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:25,692
add like a little bit of sugar
or honey or agave for like

65
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,942
the sweetness to round
all the flavors out.

66
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:32,172
Typically I have been using
Stevia in the raw so that's what

67
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,208
I'm gonna use here today
but feel free to use whatever

68
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,208
sweetener you choose, if that's
honey, if that's agave, brown

69
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,792
sugar, whatever it is
that you want, go ahead

70
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,708
and add that to the dressing.

71
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,292
For me, I like I said, I just
need it a tad bit sweet

72
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,750
and so I've been using
Stevia in the raw.

73
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:53,950
So I'll just do like half a
teaspoon of that as well.

74
00:03:54,625 --> 00:04:03,167
And then I'm gonna mix all those
ingredients up for our dressing

75
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,958
and let the lemongrass
dissolve a little bit.

76
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,333
And I'm also gonna add the
green onions to the dressing

77
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:13,292
as well to kind of soak
up the flavors of that.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It smells really
good, really fresh.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,333
Okay, so we'll go
ahead and start to plate.

80
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:32,708
We'll just put the sliced
steak on top of the salad here.

81
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:37,542
Just lay it on there.

82
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:42,083
And you can actually garnish
it with all these fresh herbs

83
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,158
before you put the steak, but
I kind of messed that one up

84
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,917
but it doesn't really matter
'cause you're gonna mix it

85
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:47,922
all together anyways.

86
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:52,208
So I'll put the
mint and the basil

87
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,500
and you've got
your steak there.

88
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:58,922
And we'll go ahead
and top it with the dressing.

89
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:05,583
Pour it all over.

90
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,588
And if you want a little more
spice, feel free to add like

91
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,500
some red chili flakes
would be really good.

92
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:14,422
Chili paste would be good if
you wanted to add that as well.

93
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:17,625
And then we're gonna
garnish it with a little bit

94
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,708
of cilantro on top.

95
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,375
So there you have it.

96
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:27,400
Really simple, really fresh
and easy but a ton of flavor.

97
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:32,630
And there you have it,
my Thai beef steak salad.

98
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:33,200
There you go.

99
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,792
I hope you guys enjoy.

100
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,208
Thank you so much.
