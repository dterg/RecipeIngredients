00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:21,135
Hi, I'm Jamie Eason and today
I'm in the BODYBUILDING.COM

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,500
kitchen, excited to show you how
I make my cinnamon swirl

4
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,009
protein bread.

5
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,642
It's one of my
favorite things to eat.

6
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,534
I can eat it at
as a snack or even as a meal,

7
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:31,642
because it's got your healthy
carb, and your healthy protein.

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,200
So, let's get started.

9
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,004
First thing you're gonna want to
do is preheat your oven

10
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,737
to 350 degrees.

11
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,934
The next thing I did
was I got my pan ready.

12
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,600
This is
an 8-by-8 inch Pyrex dish.

13
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:45,006
I just did a light
little nonstick spray

14
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,672
and you can set that aside.

15
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,033
And then I get all my
ingredients together.

16
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:52,066
And for this I want a large bowl
for my dry ingredients

17
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:54,367
and a smaller bowl for
my wet ingredients.

18
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,266
So, the first ingredient
I'm using is oat flour.

19
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,133
In the supermarket this is
what oat flour looks like.

20
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,767
Now, I'm often asked
if this is gluten-free.

21
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,776
And oats typically
are gluten-free,

22
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,675
but one thing to note is that
unless it doesn't indicate it on

23
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:11,166
the bag, you're never really
sure if maybe it was

24
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,233
cross contaminated in processing.

25
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,900
So, for this one it doesn't
indicate gluten-free,

26
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,013
but for the most part oats
are, but if you're concerned,

27
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:20,270
be sure to look for that
indication on the label.

28
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,734
If you can't find the
oats in the supermarket,

29
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,266
you can actually make your own.

30
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:26,400
You can use a coffee grinder
and just grind a little bit

31
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,137
at a time or you could use
a blender.

32
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:30,533
Just make sure to know that
sometimes you can't get it

33
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,400
as finely ground as
what's in the package.

34
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,004
So, you might have to increase
the amount that you're using

35
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:36,008
for the recipe.

36
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:39,008
In this large bowl I've added
a 1 1/2 cup of the oat flour.

37
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:42,341
And to that I'm gonna add
a vanilla whey protein.

38
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,734
Now, you can use
whichever one you'd like.

39
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,200
There's two scoops in here.

40
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,935
Make sure to know, though, that
the different flavors from

41
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,900
the different manufacturers will
make them taste differently.

42
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,017
So, I like to use one that has
as few ingredients in it

43
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,840
as possible;
the cleaner, the better.

44
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,467
So, I'm gonna dump
that into my oat flour.

45
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:02,233
And then to that I'm
gonna add my salt.

46
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,241
Now, if you use a leavening
agent like baking soda or baking

47
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:09,700
powder, you usually need salt,
because that makes it react.

48
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:12,013
Add those in.

49
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:16,570
And then to this dry ingredient
batter I'm gonna actually add

50
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:21,033
1/4 cup of Stevia.

51
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:24,867
This is what Stevia looks
like at the supermarket.

52
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:26,875
Stevia is a great natural
sweetener because it's no

53
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,600
calorie and it has no carb.

54
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:32,007
But I don't typically use just
Stevia alone to sweeten

55
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:34,440
my recipes, because it
can be kind of bitter.

56
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,834
There's different
brands of Stevia.

57
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,166
There's Stevia and there's
another brand called Truvia.

58
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:42,200
Truvia's a great option too, but
it's typically more expensive.

59
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,004
There's two sides
to the stevia plant.

60
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:46,005
This one tends to be
slightly more bitter.

61
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:47,571
It is cheaper.

62
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:50,200
And then the Truvia you usually
see it in packets or

63
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,769
in a little tiny tub for baking.

64
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,600
We're going
the cheap route today.

65
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,639
So, that's it for
our dry ingredients.

66
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,000
We do have these
two other ingredients.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,734
These are the extra special ones
that just make it extra yummy.

68
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,633
But we're gonna use those later,
so I'm gonna keep those

69
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:02,638
to the side.

70
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:07,137
I'm gonna get my whisk and
just mix this up really well.

71
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,867
Make sure I get that baking
powder all incorporated,

72
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:13,633
because sometimes if you
don't it won't bake evenly.

73
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,641
So, I think that looks good.

74
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,166
So, I'm gonna set that to the
side and get the smaller bowl

75
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,400
ready for my wet ingredients.

76
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:23,008
For the wet ingredients we're
gonna need two egg whites.

77
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,015
You can actually use a whole egg
if you want to use a whole egg.

78
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:29,671
But I prefer to minimize the fat
in pretty much any recipe if

79
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:35,667
I can do that
and my second egg.

80
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,670
And if you ever drop
the yolk in there,

81
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,900
you can just use the same
shell to fish it out.

82
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:41,542
It comes right out, so.

83
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,967
I've dropped plenty.

84
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:47,033
And then to the eggs
I'm gonna add one jar

85
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,066
of baby food applesauce.

86
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,834
Now, you can use
regular applesauce,

87
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:53,967
but one of the reasons I like
the baby food brand is there's

88
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,433
typically no additives, as
long as you read the label.

89
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,667
There's no additives and it's
nice and portion controlled.

90
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:03,834
So, I'll open that, get all
the good stuff off the top,

91
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:07,467
and then scoop this out.

92
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:10,233
But again, just unsweetened
applesauce from the jar

93
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,667
that works just as well.

94
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,700
That's my additional
sweetener--one of them to

95
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,008
the Stevia, which actually will
cut some of that bitterness.

96
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,012
Next thing I'm gonna add
is gonna be my yogurt.

97
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,435
And I choose Greek yogurt,
because Greek yogurt

98
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,400
actually has less sugar
and it has added protein.

99
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:27,012
So, I only need a half
a container of this.

100
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,435
So, I'm gonna scoop that out.

101
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,834
That's gonna add some
moisture to this bread.

102
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,400
The baby food applesauce and
the yogurt actually replace

103
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,009
the butter and oil in a
traditional recipe.

104
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,017
So, I'll add that.

105
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:42,274
And then for a substitute
for milk I'm using my

106
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:43,976
unsweetened Almond Breeze.

107
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,400
Now, Almond Breeze, again, I
like this better than say soy

108
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:50,371
or rice milk, because it
has, again, added protein.

109
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,400
So, it's just more nutritious
and it's healthy fat.

110
00:04:53,004 --> 00:04:54,837
So, I'll add that.

111
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:59,233
I'm gonna do about a cup.

112
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:03,900
And that's about it
for my wet ingredients.

113
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:05,542
Make sure I combine
that really well.

114
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,767
This is really
a pretty simple recipe.

115
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,066
And it tastes
really, really good.

116
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,000
It's, again, one
of my favorites.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can actually make this in
either the 8-by-8 like we're

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,567
gonna do or you can do it
in a traditional loaf pan.

119
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,500
Now that I've mixed all
the wet ingredients,

120
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:21,012
I'm gonna add the wet
ingredients to

121
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,010
the dry ingredients.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,008
So, I'll get my large bowl back.

123
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,341
And I'm gonna get my
little rubber spatula,

124
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:30,467
so I can get all of the wet
ingredients out of there.

125
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:32,200
Just really scrap the bowl.

126
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:34,007
The more moisture, the better,
'cause then they'll be nice

127
00:05:34,007 --> 00:05:36,573
and moist and stay that way.

128
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,033
Not get dried out.

129
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:46,033
So, I've added the wet to the
dry and I'm gonna mix that.

130
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,734
And let's see.

131
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,633
And you want it to
be slightly runny,

132
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,934
because it needs to
pour really easily.

133
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:57,066
So, if it's too thick, you can
always add a little bit more of

134
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,734
the Almond Breeze
or almond milk,

135
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,066
whichever brand
you want to choose.

136
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,066
Alright, that looks pretty good.

137
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,967
I'm always tempted to lick it,
but I won't 'cause there's

138
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,975
raw eggs in there.

139
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:13,767
So, I'm now gonna set this to
the side again because now

140
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm gonna start using my
special dry ingredients.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,007
Here I've got my cinnamon
and I've got Xylitol.

142
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:23,074
Now, Xylitol is the other brand
of sweetener that I like to use

143
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,700
or the other type of
sweetener, because this one,

144
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:29,009
even though it's no calorie,
it actually has carbs,

145
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:32,014
but it is far less bitter
than something like Stevia.

146
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,008
So, I find whenever I use both
it kind of balances out

147
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,374
that bitterness.

148
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,333
So, I'm gonna add my
cinnamon to my Xylitol.

149
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,700
This is a 1/3 of a cup.

150
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,640
You can use more or less.

151
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,200
I just like my cinnamon swirl
protein bread pretty sweet.

152
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:47,569
And I'm gonna add 2 or
3 teaspoons of cinnamon.

153
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:49,533
Again, however much you like.

154
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:50,538
I added 3.

155
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:52,467
I really, really like cinnamon.

156
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,266
So, I'll pour that in.

157
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:58,834
You mix that up really well.

158
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:02,033
Now, Xylitol does tend to be
a little more granular than

159
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:06,700
traditional sugar and more
granular than the Stevia,

160
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:09,041
but I think that's good, because
it actually helps sort of

161
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,200
maintain that layer that
we're trying to create

162
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,769
in our protein bread.

163
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,633
And also, I don't
know if you know,

164
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,066
but Xylitol is actually the same
thing that's used in fluoride

165
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:22,033
toothpaste and it's actually
good for your teeth.

166
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,900
So, imagine that; a sugar
that's good for your teeth.

167
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:26,542
So, I think that's
nice and mixed.

168
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:28,439
Looks pretty good.

169
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,035
So, now I'm gonna set
these things aside.

170
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:34,667
Grab my pan.

171
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,066
Now, we'll start putting
together our dessert.

172
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:42,300
I'm gonna pour a really shallow
layer on the bottom of the pan,

173
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,006
kind of spread that out.

174
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,039
The thinner, the better, because
if you pour half the batter,

175
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,734
which seems like
that should be fine,

176
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:53,133
typically you're gonna kind of
miss that little cinnamon layer

177
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:55,100
that's in between.

178
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:59,368
So, I'll spread that
out really well.

179
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,700
That looks pretty good.

180
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:02,874
And again, depending
on your protein,

181
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,576
the consistency of your batter
might vary a little bit.

182
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:09,300
So, now I'm gonna add
my cinnamon Xylitol

183
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,008
mixture--cinnamon sugar,
we'll just call it that.

184
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:12,015
Sounds better.

185
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:14,011
And it's pretty heavy.

186
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:20,167
I like to actually
add more than half.

187
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,333
So, that's covered pretty well.

188
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,367
Got about that much left,
I guess, for the top.

189
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,233
And that's what my
middle looks like.

190
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,967
So, then I'm gonna pour the
rest of the batter on top.

191
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:35,166
And you just kind of want to do
it where it's, you know, even.

192
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,000
Make sure you get it all
covered and...

193
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:46,633
Alright, that looks pretty good.

194
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:50,633
So, I'm gonna spread that out.

195
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,066
And then I'm just gonna add
the rest of the cinnamon sugar

196
00:08:54,066 --> 00:09:00,068
on top.

197
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:03,133
The nice thing about this too
is that it looks really pretty.

198
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:06,500
And if you make it
actually in the loaf pan,

199
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:09,838
you can cut slices and actually
use it to make French toast,

200
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,066
which is pretty good as well.

201
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,467
So, I'm gonna take my knife now
and to make a swirl

202
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:17,934
I'm gonna draw my knife
through the batter.

203
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,633
Can do it however you want
just kind of make sure

204
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,734
it's incorporated.

205
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:25,166
I just kind of go back
and forth a little bit.

206
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,467
Now I'm gonna put it in the oven
that remember I preheated

207
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:31,066
before at 350 degrees.

208
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,867
Okay.
It's been 24 minutes.

209
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:44,266
Let's check our
cinnamon protein bread.

210
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:46,400
Your oven, depending
on the temperature,

211
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:48,571
they kind of vary
sometimes it's 24 minutes,

212
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,300
sometimes it might be
more like 30 minutes.

213
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:57,370
So, let's check and
see how ours looks.

214
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,033
Okay.

215
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,667
It looks pretty good.

216
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,834
I think now we've got to let it
cool down for about 5-10 minutes

217
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,633
before we can actually
cut it into serving sizes.

218
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,640
Okay, now I'm gonna cut
this into serving sizes.

219
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,867
Let's see.

220
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:17,800
I do about three cuts
this way and then three

221
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:19,008
in the opposite direction.

222
00:10:19,008 --> 00:10:24,474
And that should make 16
for your 8-by-8 inch pan.

223
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,266
And about two squares really
would be a serving size.

224
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:30,967
For a guy you could get away
with maybe three or even four

225
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:34,400
if you really, really want
to indulge, I guess.

226
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:36,637
But two squares is
gonna have, you know,

227
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:42,734
just around only 100 calories
and it's about 8 or so grams

228
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,700
of protein, about 8 carbs.

229
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:47,016
It just depends on the type of
protein that you decide to use.

230
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,014
So, looks pretty good.

231
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:52,271
You can see the little,
hopefully you can kind of see

232
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,333
the little layer of
cinnamon in there.

233
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,667
It's a little
harder to see here,

234
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,667
'cause my cutting
skills are poor.

235
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:02,200
But, let's see what
it tastes like.

236
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,935
Tastes pretty good.
[giggling]

237
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,900
You're gonna want to
make sure you store these

238
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,442
in the frigerator.

239
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,867
There's no artificial
flavors or preservatives.

240
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,200
and also, if you want to see how
I pack these to take them with

241
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,335
me when I travel, check out
the pumpkin protein bar video
