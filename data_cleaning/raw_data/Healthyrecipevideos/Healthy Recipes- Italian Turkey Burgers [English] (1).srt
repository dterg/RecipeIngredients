1
00:00:01,036 --> 00:00:04,080
the

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,049
that

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:09,067
%uh

4
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,076
mom

5
00:00:11,057 --> 00:00:14,065
%uh

6
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:16,106
the

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:21,074
%uh how I'm saying he said in today and
in the body lean back on teaching an

8
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:21,125
enemy

9
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:26,031
maintain textiles including burgers I'm
I've already started

10
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:29,910
by putting my head then and setting it
on broil you want to set it on high

11
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:31,660
there's high and low settings

12
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:35,068
make she put on high and I've missed a
rack to the top about two inches from

13
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,164
the heating element

14
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:40,092
well at all so I degrade my sicky me

15
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:44,251
I'm using to pound turkey and for every
pound turkey

16
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,420
I've created to use it teenies so we've
got

17
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:52,501
quite a busy teeny and

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,950
makes a lot of issues but we want that
because turkey tends to be really dry

19
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,820
so that's why we're put music in there
in the first place at all add some

20
00:00:59,082 --> 00:00:59,741
moisture

21
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,280
so I want all the liquid as much as I
can get

22
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:07,187
try to bounce at sample

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,090
right

24
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,968
and then after that is you can AM I had
all my spices

25
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,142
this is a really easy easy are recipe
it's got

26
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,032
one measuring spoon which is a teaspoon
so have got a teaspoon pepper here

27
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,490
1 teaspoon of garlic

28
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,558
27 assault

29
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:36,017
1 teaspoon oregano

30
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,710
an entity spends a penny in powder

31
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,110
and 2 teaspoons it pays off

32
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:46,100
that's it its last green staff

33
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:54,009
and Emma had the turkey

34
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:02,064
and this is where you get your hands
dirty meet its reach in and start

35
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:03,114
mission at

36
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:07,053
never wanna

37
00:02:07,053 --> 00:02:10,060
overwork protein because they can tend
to get a little bit tough

38
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:15,074
so just really can ask questions pick it
up unfolded over into you get all

39
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:15,166
incorporated

40
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:22,074
you can make this

41
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:26,078
same recipe with really any sort of me
whether it's the four maybe ground

42
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:26,174
chicken breast

43
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:31,165
actually prefer lean ground chicken
breasts but actually it's really hard to

44
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:35,126
find and not every but you make senator
every grocery store offers it

45
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:39,101
looking pretty good

46
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:44,068
now I've already prepped my can I
covered it in foil because this can get

47
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:44,077
pretty messy

48
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:48,116
and dizzy he had a lot of liquid so
sometimes it's a little rainy

49
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:53,070
you can make these on the grill if you
prefer but for me the broilers just easy

50
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,055
cleanups that's why i like it now I just
need an

51
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:59,031
for knees into patties I get about a
palm full

52
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:04,097
nune aim for maybe about an 45 counts is
this whole recipe makes about

53
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:11,097
and ninety tenders this is actually a
really great

54
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:19,091
I low carb options says you can ease are
a car but

55
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:26,091
there's very few carbs and I'm
distressed he's also really versatile

56
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:30,094
instead have burgers you can make them
into meatballs and put them on

57
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:33,095
spaghetti squash and there's another low
carb option

58
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:36,150
for me spaghetti squash is a lifesaver
whenever I'm started in that low carb

59
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:37,064
phase

60
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,035
and something like this makes me think
that makes me feel like a man and

61
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:41,118
spaghetti

62
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:46,097
also using the greater to create a few
vegetables and things like that not only

63
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:48,120
does add moisture to your needs

64
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:52,049
but adds more volume so even a it seems
like

65
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:55,161
me be Rand like for instance it here
having a party or something you've got

66
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,064
to make a dollar stretch

67
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:01,123
you can add lots of grated vegetables to
things now actually create more suited

68
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:05,070
to the more you kenya Red a great at the
family had to come to Turkey

69
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,094
it actually might make more patties so
second an average my hands of

70
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:12,109
cannot just got a dip in and

71
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:18,938
with a broiler you're actually getting
treated just like a gorilla and

72
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,590
this one I usually like to do about
seven to eight minutes on each side

73
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,144
depending on how hot your add an S

74
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:27,121
I miss at mine for seven minutes and the
mall open it for the mother and 27

75
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:28,083
minutes more

76
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:35,083
okay we flip the burgers and

77
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,017
it's been seven minutes on one side and
now seven minutes on the other

78
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:48,053
let's get a map

79
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:54,061
Kelly

80
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:58,102
K say always wanna make sure it's done

81
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:04,088
switches can and poke into one see know
clinton sad they really to see

82
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:07,097
its good sign and I guess I'll just put
one together you can you can buy

83
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:10,087
themselves region a low carb thing

84
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:13,116
or another option is to use Ezekiel then

85
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:17,091
or and in a bread you really want that
for for these

86
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:20,097
at the are only made from sprouted
grains

87
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:24,103
so if you look at the ingredients there
there's nothing artificial and you can

88
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,085
only find in the freezer section

89
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:29,171
he's our fans teaser at an English
lesson which is another

90
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,169
options and then you've also got stuck
bread so-so different ones have

91
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:35,071
different carrier caps

92
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:40,107
think I'm gonna go for an English muffin
you can test a

93
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,043
you can even soft whatever you'd like
remain soft

94
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:51,115
staff government ban many

95
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:59,015
miss I sipped media

96
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:09,046
and cheese slices a little bit less

97
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:14,629
and then whatever condiments you want to
put on this and

98
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,651
kachuck where or add mustard might work

99
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,874
I like to catch it this is the reduced
sugar variety just make sure you get one

100
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,107
