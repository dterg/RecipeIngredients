00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:15,266
I'm Natalie Hodson, and I'm
here in the bodybuilding.com

3
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,500
kitchen today, showing you how
to make one of my favorite side

4
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,009
dish recipes and I call
it Death-by-Garlic

5
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,943
Roasted Asparagus.

6
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:25,000
And it's a really good side dish
to go with chicken or tilapia

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,003
and it even works
great as leftovers.

8
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:29,009
I put it in a Ziploc bag
and use it the next day.

9
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,542
For today's recipe, this is a
pretty simple recipe though we

10
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,440
only use a few ingredients
and I have everything here.

11
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:38,166
We are going to use fresh
asparagus and use about

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,667
1 pound of asparagus.

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:42,033
They usually come in
bundles like this.

14
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:45,036
And some asparagus is a little
bit more thin and some asparagus

15
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,367
is a little bit thicker and
it doesn't really matter,

16
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,266
you can use either.

17
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,100
We're gonna use fresh garlic and
some garlic does come pre-minced

18
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,007
but I prefer the fresh garlic.

19
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:55,974
I think it makes the recipe
taste a little bit better

20
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:59,667
so we're gonna just buy
the garlic clove like this.

21
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:03,200
And then we are going to use
garlic powder and just make sure

22
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:05,009
that you get the garlic powder
and not the garlic salt.

23
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:06,676
They look real similar.

24
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,200
They come in the same size of
container but the garlic salt

25
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,968
has quite a bit of salt added to
it and the garlic powder is just

26
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,233
straight garlic.

27
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,300
And then we are going to use
extra virgin olive oil and we're

28
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:21,437
just gonna use 1 tablespoon
of this, so just a little bit.

29
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:25,266
And then some pepper and I have
fresh ground pepper but you

30
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,000
could--if you don't
have the fresh ground,

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,533
just regular black
pepper will work as well.

32
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,800
And then we're gonna bake
everything on a cookie sheet

33
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,875
and line it with aluminum foil
and I already went ahead

34
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,200
and pre-heated my oven
to 400 degrees.

35
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,007
So the first thing we're gonna
do is line a cookie sheet with

36
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:45,141
aluminum foil.

37
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,000
And this just makes for
easier cleanup so that way,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,005
when you're done, all you have
to do is take your aluminum foil

39
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:55,571
out, throw it in the trash and
it's really easy to clean up.

40
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,468
Okay.

41
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:03,033
So then we're just
gonna set this aside.

42
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:05,567
First, we just take
our bunch of asparagus,

43
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:12,066
take off the rubber bands
and then just rinse this,

44
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:22,700
make sure that gets nice and
rinsed and then what I do is I

45
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:26,640
like to keep the asparagus still
in the bunch formation and you

46
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,341
want to cut off the bottom about
inch of the stalk and--because

47
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,834
the bottom of the stalk is
really tough and it doesn't

48
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,233
taste good, it's
not fun to chew.

49
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:37,734
So what I do is I just take a
kitchen knife and I just cut it

50
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:43,400
all at once so it's
really fast and easy.

51
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:45,737
And you just cut off the bottom
of the asparagus and then what

52
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,300
you're gonna do is evenly
distribute the asparagus over

53
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:55,670
the cookie sheet.

54
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,971
The next step is
mincing the garlic.

55
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,369
So garlic, when it
comes in a clove,

56
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:03,568
has an outer shell kind of like
an onion and so what I usually

57
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:09,233
do is just cut the end off just
so it's easier to peel and then

58
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:13,767
there's some stuff, I just throw
that away and then there's--if

59
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,033
you can see inside, there's a
lot of little what are called

60
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:20,038
garlic cloves, so you just
take out--this recipe calls for

61
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,166
anywhere from four to six garlic
cloves and it just depends on

62
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,000
how much garlic you like.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,002
I usually--I like a lot of
garlic so I err on the side of

64
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:32,235
six but if you don't like
garlic as much or as strong,

65
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:34,367
then you could just do four.

66
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:37,166
And another thing too,
if you don't like garlic,

67
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:41,133
you could actually make this
recipe even without the garlic

68
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,367
and just use salt and pepper
and it would still taste

69
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,500
pretty good.

70
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,439
All right.

71
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,333
So I'm just gonna set this aside

72
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,000
and we have six
garlic cloves here.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,166
Now these still have kind of
an outer papery shell on them.

74
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,667
And so you need
to take that off.

75
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,200
So what you do is you just put
the garlic clove flat on your

76
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:01,007
cutting board, take a knife that
has kind of a wider flat edge

77
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,015
and you just go like this and
you just hit it and what it does

78
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,072
is it kind of crushes your
garlic so it makes it really

79
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:10,570
easy to pull but it
actually, I found out,

80
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:13,233
this one has two
cloves inside of it

81
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,700
so I'm gonna do that again.

82
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:17,874
And then it makes it really
easy just to peel off

83
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:22,066
the outer shell.

84
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:26,500
So I'm just gonna
do this for all six.

85
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:27,938
I really like--I
eat asparagus a lot.

86
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:31,467
I really like eating asparagus
and one thing that a lot of

87
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:36,700
people don't know is that
asparagus is actually really

88
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:39,874
high in folate and a lot of
pregnant women are recommended

89
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,900
to take folic acid which is the
supplemental form of folate

90
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:48,142
and so asparagus is really good
for pregnant women too.

91
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:53,734
And asparagus is also a natural
diuretic so if you feel like

92
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:55,735
you're holding on to some water
weight or if you're feeling kind

93
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:59,843
of bloated, sometimes eating
some asparagus can help your

94
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:06,736
body rid itself of
some of that water.

95
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,266
All right.

96
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,900
So your hands are gonna feel
kind of sticky when

97
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,014
you're doing this.

98
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:14,538
That's okay, that's normal.

99
00:05:14,934 --> 00:05:17,633
One, two, three, four, five.

100
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,567
All right.

101
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,266
So since that original clove
actually was two cloves inside

102
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:28,867
of it, I'm gonna set
one of them to the side.

103
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:31,133
And then I just throw
all the paper stuff away.

104
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:34,100
Sometimes it sticks to
your hand a little bit.

105
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,468
I just rinse my fingers.

106
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,300
All right.

107
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:41,537
So we're gonna mince the garlic
really finely and I'm just gonna

108
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,600
do that with a knife.

109
00:05:43,006 --> 00:05:46,340
We already took the outer
shell off, the papery part,

110
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,767
and I just put my hand on the
top and I kind of bunch it

111
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:57,200
together and then I just mince it like this

112
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,636
and I just keep pressure on the top of the knife

113
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:02,433
and I just kind of keep going back and forth

114
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:07,800
and then what I
do is bunch it back together

115
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:12,841
and just keep mincing,
just like this.

116
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,567
And you just want it really
pretty finely minced because you

117
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:19,567
don't want anybody to take
a big old chunk of garlic.

118
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:24,433
They might not
appreciate you for that.

119
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:29,667
So this is looking pretty good.

120
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:33,834
I would say that's about as
finely minced as you want.

121
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:40,166
So I'm going to rinse my hands.

122
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:45,175
And then I'm gonna set
this aside for a second.

123
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,934
And then what we're gonna
do is put the olive oil on.

124
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:55,035
So I just use
1 tablespoon of olive oil.

125
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:59,235
Now this recipe makes four
servings and so each serving is

126
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:02,600
gonna have less than a
teaspoon of olive oil.

127
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:06,039
So I do--I like to measure it
out because sometimes I have

128
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:09,700
a tendency to use too much olive
oil so I just like to measure it

129
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:12,174
out that way and know I'm
just using a tablespoon.

130
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:16,700
And I just slowly
drizzle it over.

131
00:07:16,007 --> 00:07:19,041
Just like this.

132
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:23,000
And then what I'll do is I'll
take either a spatula or even

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,367
just the measuring spoon and
I'll just sort of go like this

134
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:33,367
just to make sure that the olive
oil doesn't get wasted on

135
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:37,369
the bottom of the cookie sheet
and that it gets over

136
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,633
all the asparagus.

137
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,934
So then what we're gonna do
is we're gonna take the garlic

138
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:45,900
powder so if you have thicker
stalks you might not need quite

139
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:50,175
as much garlic powder, but
if you have more stalks,

140
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,767
you might need a
little bit more,

141
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:53,775
if you have thinner stalks.

142
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:59,066
So I just sprinkle--this is
1 teaspoon and that didn't

143
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,066
even cover half of it so
I'm gonna do it again,

144
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:03,700
3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon.

145
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:05,840
So just gonna keep sprinkling
and it looks like I'm gonna use

146
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,900
the whole tablespoon for this
recipe 'cause remember this is

147
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,242
called Death-by-Garlic Asparagus
so it's gonna be pretty heavy

148
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,135
on the garlic.

149
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,734
And if you don't
like garlic, again,

150
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:18,300
you can use lighter garlic or
even no garlic and just use

151
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:20,236
salt and pepper.

152
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,500
And then I'm gonna use some
fresh ground pepper and this,

153
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,339
I just kind of eyeball it.

154
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,300
You could probably
use about a teaspoon,

155
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:29,011
maybe 2 teaspoons and if you
don't have the fresh ground,

156
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:33,005
just regular black
pepper will work.

157
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,938
And if you wanted to
add some salt, you can,

158
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,433
but I usually just
don't add extra salt.

159
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:42,934
And then what I'm going to do is
take my knife and kind of scoop

160
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:46,867
the garlic onto the knife and
then just evenly distribute this

161
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:48,934
over the asparagus.

162
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:52,934
So I just take my finger
and I just go like this.

163
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:56,100
Now if you were to eat
a raw garlic clove,

164
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,268
your eyes would probably water
up and your mouth would probably

165
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,400
start to burn because it's
really spicy but when you

166
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:03,971
roast it like we're gonna
do on 400 degrees,

167
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:07,433
it kind of takes some of the
spiciness out of the garlic and

168
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,800
it makes it have more
of the garlic flavor

169
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,675
that we're used to.

170
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,800
So that's it.

171
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:15,008
All I'm gonna do is rinse my
hands and then stick this in

172
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:18,241
the oven at 400 degrees
and I'm gonna cook it for

173
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,734
15 to 20 minutes.

174
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,600
So what I'm going to do
is put this in the oven,

175
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,012
set the timer for 10 minutes.

176
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:26,669
At 10 minutes, I'm gonna take a
spatula and just kind of rotate

177
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:31,900
the asparagus a little bit to
make sure that one side doesn't

178
00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:33,943
get burnt or crispy and then I'm
gonna put it back in the oven

179
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,433
anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

180
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,367
And if it starts
to look too brown,

181
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:39,372
then I'll pull it
out at 5 minutes.

182
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,000
Usually I cook it for
the full 20 minutes.

183
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,734
All right.

184
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,700
So we just took the
asparagus out of the oven.

185
00:09:48,007 --> 00:09:50,013
At 10 minutes, we checked the
asparagus, just rotate it,

186
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:53,836
make sure it wasn't burning and
then at 15 minutes we checked it

187
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:56,166
again and what I like to look
for is to make sure that

188
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,934
the garlic starts to kind
of turn brown a little bit

189
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:02,400
and actually at 15 minutes ours
looked good so you can cook it

190
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:05,009
15 and up to 20 minutes but we
took ours out at 15 minutes.

191
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:13,013
And then what I do is I just use
my spatula and put the asparagus

192
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:17,036
onto a plate.

193
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,266
Just like that.

194
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:24,900
And this asparagus is a little
bit thinner which is probably

195
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,976
why we were able to take
it out at 15 minutes too.

196
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:28,873
If your asparagus is
a little bit thicker,

197
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,166
you'll probably want to go
closer towards

198
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,667
the 20-minute mark.

199
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,200
And this looks really good.

200
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:35,435
I'm gonna clean up
this super easy.

201
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,867
All I do is fold up
the aluminum foil,

202
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:40,874
throw it in the trash and
this looks really good

203
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,200
so I'm gonna try it.

204
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,004
And you can serve this warm
or you can serve it chilled

205
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:49,338
as well.

206
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,967
Tastes really good.

207
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,233
