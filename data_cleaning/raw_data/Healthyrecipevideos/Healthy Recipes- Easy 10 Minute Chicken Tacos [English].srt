[music]

3
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,338
Hi, I'm Christine Avanti,
celebrity nutritionist and chef.

4
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:23,000
Today I'm going to be teaching
you how to make my world-famous

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,967
10-minute tacos.

6
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,011
But before I get started, I
just want to give you a rundown

7
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,635
on what the ingredients are.

8
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,100
So very simple, we're starting
out with some grilled chicken

9
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:39,468
breast, okay?

10
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:44,567
I'm going to be topping my tacos
with some shredded lettuce, some

11
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,570
salsa.

12
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:48,867
I'm gonna use a little bit of
black beans and low-fat shredded

13
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:53,433
cheese and just as a side,
I've got some brown rice, okay?

14
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,900
We also are using
white corn tortillas.

15
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,014
I love these guys.

16
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:01,071
I'm gonna garnish with some
fresh lime and some cilantro.

17
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:03,468
Mmm, so good, I love it.

18
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,734
And a little bit of
avocado, a right?

19
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:07,266
Are you guys ready?

20
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:08,934
I'm hungry so I'm
gonna get started.

21
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,333
All right, so we're gonna start
with a little bit of olive oil,

22
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:15,567
just a teeny bit, just for some
cooking, get that chicken

23
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,568
cooked up.

24
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:21,033
I've got my pan on medium high.

25
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:23,266
Just gonna let that
heat up for a second.

26
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:27,300
Every good chef loves to season
with salt and pepper, and I know

27
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,070
people are afraid of salt
but I'm not afraid of salt.

28
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:31,133
I eat healthy all the time.

29
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,137
I exercise a lot so salt is not
going to kill me or my clients.

30
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,066
If you have high blood pressure,
then that's a different story.

31
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,600
So we've got some salt in there
always gonna go with the base,

32
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:40,672
fresh-cracked pepper.

33
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:44,500
This chicken breast--see, my
husband seems to like this and

34
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:45,439
guys really like this.

35
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:50,467
This is pre-made, store-bought,
cut up chicken breast.

36
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:53,633
I'm not the hugest fan of that
but if you're in a hurry,

37
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:56,066
it's good just to buy chicken
breast already cut up and made.

38
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,400
You can buy it at the grocery
store, Trader Joe's, wherever.

39
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:00,237
So I'm gonna put
my chicken in here.

40
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:06,567
It's about 4 ounces
of chicken breast.

41
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,400
Okay.

42
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:10,637
That's 4 ounces.

43
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,400
Let me wash my
hand really quick.

44
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:15,737
I'm sorry, guys, but you
can't cross contaminate.

45
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,867
Sorry.

46
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:23,100
So when you touch meat, you
always want to wash your hands

47
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:26,067
with hot, soapy water because
cross contamination can be a

48
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,333
problem in the kitchen.

49
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,734
I'm gonna season.

50
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:31,367
Instead of using the packet of
taco seasoning that's high in

51
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:34,033
sodium and preservatives, I'm
gonna use some fresh spices,

52
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:37,266
just a little bit of
paprika, just sprinkling.

53
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,934
You don't have to get
out a measuring spoon.

54
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:42,700
This is some chili powder and
it's gonna start to smoke,

55
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:43,974
which I love.

56
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:48,734
Some cayenne pepper, some
crushed red pepper and a little

57
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:50,133
bit of cumin.

58
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:55,400
Cumin is a spice that you will
see a lot in Spanish and Latin

59
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:56,011
cooking.

60
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,768
We're smoking, whoo, hoo, hoo.

61
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,500
Okay.

62
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:03,571
Literally because this is
pre-made chicken breast, I'm

63
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:07,600
just gonna look it for just like
a minute, just to get the spices

64
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,839
on it.

65
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,100
And also when you heat a spice,
that lets the flavor release so

66
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:16,635
kind of fun, kind of cool.

67
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:20,600
Smells good.

68
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,240
And I think that this chicken
breast looks prettier with the

69
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:23,843
spices on it.

70
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,700
All right, so I'm
turning off my heat.

71
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,674
I'm moving my pan over.

72
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:32,934
Let that cool off.

73
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:33,942
The spices are making me cough.

74
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,433
It's how it happens.

76
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:42,433
Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna get my tortillas ready.

77
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,439
Now if you have a gas range
at home, you just turn on your

78
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:50,834
heat, kind of to low, throw
the tortilla right over it.

79
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,867
You don't spray, you
don't do anything.

80
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,700
Just put the tortilla
right over it.

81
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:58,041
If you don't have a gas stove
at home and you have an electric

82
00:03:58,734 --> 00:04:01,600
stove, that little like
coil-looking thing, heating

83
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:05,009
element, as they call it, you
can put it on that too, medium

84
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:07,676
high, just make sure that it's
clean and it's not like coated

85
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:10,934
with like sticky like Cream
of Wheat from yesterday or

86
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,533
something.

87
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:17,542
And you just leave it on there
and then I hope every healthy

88
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:21,433
cook at home as a set of tongs
because if you don't, you need

89
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,500
to go by some.

90
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,538
They're like a dollar
at Target, okay?

91
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:28,967
Go get yourself some tongs
because you're gonna use those

92
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,300
to flip over your tortillas.

93
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,270
You use them for a lot of
things, but for this meal, it's

94
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,200
for tortillas.

95
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:40,068
Just get some fire on the--look
at how pretty that is.

96
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:44,734
Just like a Martha Stewart photo
at the end of the day when I'm

97
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:45,767
done with these.

98
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:49,266
We'll make them so pretty
that Martha will be proud.

99
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:54,333
Okay, they're almost done.

100
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,166
And you know what?

101
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,175
If you don't have--if you don't
feel like heating them on your

102
00:04:58,066 --> 00:05:00,068
heating element, on your stove,
on your gas range, you can

103
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,567
always just microwave them.

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,200
I'm not a big fan of the
microwave but last case

105
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,536
scenario--worst case scenario,
go ahead and throw them on

106
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,736
there.

107
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,934
This one looks like it's
literally on fire, which is

108
00:05:13,934 --> 00:05:16,500
fine.

109
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:19,771
Okay, so I'm turning
all the burners off.

110
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:25,300
And I'm going to very quickly
cut up my avocado 'cause that's

111
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:31,009
gonna go into my taco.

112
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,342
And I just want to cut a lime
'cause we want a little bit of

113
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:40,700
lime juice once we're ready
to build the taco here.

114
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:44,940
And then I'm just gonna
cut a tiny bit of cilantro.

115
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:49,467
Chop it up real quick
so we've got that.

116
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,472
Now, these tacos,
it's not super hot.

117
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,400
I can hold it with my hand.

118
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,271
It's no big deal.

119
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm gonna take my
chicken--look at this chicken.

120
00:05:58,002 --> 00:06:00,769
It's gorgeous, a lot
better-looking than that chicken

121
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,100
I had before, right?

122
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:03,934
Put it in there.

123
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,400
Okay, it's a little hot.

124
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:05,770
Ow.

125
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,800
Okay, cool off,
cool off, cool off.

126
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:12,241
I'm gonna put a little bit
of--I'll put some rice in here.

127
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:16,039
I'm put some black beans.

128
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,867
It's kind of hot.

129
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:19,600
Hold on, you guys.

130
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:19,739
Wow.

131
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,400
I think I might have
grabbed it too soon.

132
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,013
Okay, so mental note, don't grab
the tortillas straight off of

133
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:27,011
the stove, give it a
second to cool off.

134
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,004
I mean I'm not completely
burning to where I need to go to

135
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,637
the emergency room
but I'm burnt.

136
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,467
It hurts.

137
00:06:33,467 --> 00:06:38,333
Okay, so there I'm gonna put
a little bit of fresh lettuce.

138
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,333
I'm gonna put a little
bit of fresh cheese.

139
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,100
How pretty is that?

140
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,034
There's one taco.

141
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,266
I wasn't lying when I
said 10 minutes, kids.

142
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,900
Ten minutes.

143
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,342
Okay, put this bad boy on here.

144
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:53,300
More of my--hey, Mr. Avocado,
I know you wanted to go for a

145
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:56,570
ride, but I'll use
you in a minute.

146
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,868
Okay, more chicken.

147
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:03,433
Again, look at this chicken
compared to straight from the

148
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,967
store, okay?

149
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,500
We got some quick here.

150
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,339
We kicked it up a notch.

151
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,333
Thanks, Emeril.

152
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,734
Okay, and I just
touched chicken.

153
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:11,967
All right, sorry.

154
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:12,974
Washing my hands.

155
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:17,400
Okay, a little bit of rice,
a little bit of black beans.

156
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:21,137
It's not a ton, but,
you know, it's enough.

157
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:24,538
Some people like their cheese
right up against the warm parts.

158
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:27,039
We can do it this one like that,
put the cheese right there,

159
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:31,767
a little bit of lettuce,
some avocado slices.

160
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:35,233
And I've got some salsa as well
so we can put some salsa on

161
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:39,237
there when we're done.

162
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,500
Give it a little bit of
cilantro,

163
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:45,138
little squeeze of lime.

164
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,967
Simple.

165
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:47,934
We'll make our last taco.

166
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,942
This tortilla was really hot so
I was giving it a few minutes to

167
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:52,767
cool off.

168
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,768
I think we're there.

169
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,333
It feels good to me.

170
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,100
Last little bit of chicken.

171
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:01,635
If you guys don't have spices at
your house, like cumin, cayenne

172
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:05,400
pepper, paprika, chili powder,
you should go get some because

173
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:08,471
it really makes food
taste good, okay?

174
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:12,868
It makes food taste phenomenal
and I think that we--not only do

175
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,973
we like good-tasting food but,
as humans, we eat with our eyes

176
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:20,900
so we want the food to
look pretty as well.

177
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,013
And just because it's healthy,
does not mean it has to look

178
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,570
bland and not fun, okay?

179
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:28,533
Little bit of cilantro.

180
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:32,667
I'll do my lime again,
yummy, yummy, yummy.

181
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,033
Who wouldn't want to eat these?

182
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,800
That's what I want to know.

183
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,014
I'm gonna eat them.

184
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:40,071
So we've got three
tacos, little tacos.

185
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,066
I mean these tortillas
were pretty small.

186
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,500
They weren't that big.

187
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:46,239
You get a little bit of extra
brown rice on the side for a

188
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,233
little bit more carb.

189
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,934
These tacos are only about 10
to 12 grams of carbohydrate per

190
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:55,943
tortilla, so that's why we're
adding a little bit more black

191
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:59,000
beans and brown rice to it.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,633
You can put your salsa there on
the plate for just prettiness.

193
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,834
And did we already give it lime?

194
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:08,767
I'm gonna give it a
little bit more lime.

195
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,768
We love lime.

196
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:12,934
Lime definitely helps the flavor
and we're gonna put some more

197
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:13,900
avocado.

198
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,976
Here's the great thing about
this meal, avocado is loaded

199
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,700
with what we call mono
and saturated fatty acids.

200
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:22,440
These mono and saturated
fatty acids are good fats.

201
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:26,133
They've been clinically shown in
several studies, one particular

202
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,734
a Yale study, that actually
helped reduce belly fat by 33%

203
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,200
in people who were dieting.

204
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:33,006
Another study showed that mono
and saturated fatty acids that

205
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,672
come from avocado, our dear
friend the avocado right there,

206
00:09:36,266 --> 00:09:40,300
were actually people who were
eating the more of these good

207
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:43,006
fats from avocado were losing
more weight than other dieters

208
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:45,010
that were eating the
same amount of calories.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,667
So it's not only about calories
in versus calories out.

210
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,500
It's about what
are your calories?

211
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,239
Are you eating good fats?

212
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,367
Are you eating lean proteins?

213
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:54,372
Are you eating processed food?

214
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,200
If you're gonna eat a processed
meal that's 400 calories versus

215
00:09:57,002 --> 00:10:00,569
a meal made of real food
that's 400 calories.

216
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,000
Trust me, the real food meal is
gonna help your body get filter

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,834
and leaner faster
than anything else.

218
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,100
So I'm putting all
my avocado on here.

219
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,735
Put a little bit on our rice.

220
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,767
Who says you can't have
avocado on rice, right?

221
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:14,100
Little bit more black beans.

222
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,007
I like to mix up my
black beans with my rice.

223
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:18,940
I just think it's more
exciting and more fun.

224
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:22,767
And here you go.

225
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,533
You've got my 10-minute tacos,
377 calories for this

226
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:30,000
entire plate, 20 grams of
protein, 50 grams of carbs.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,967
You're good to go.

228
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,533
All right, I'm Christine Avanti.
