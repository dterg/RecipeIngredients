00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:04,378
the

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:05,460
that

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:05,121
%uh

4
00:00:06,021 --> 00:00:08,069
%uh %uh

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:10,132
%uh mom

6
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:15,046
%uh

7
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,132
are

8
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:20,096
%uh I i'm jeannie than welcome to the
body burned out complex

9
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:23,107
today I'm gonna make my protein bars

10
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,091
and I have been making a whole lot if it
takes a protein bars but don't get

11
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,030
burned out suck at this brand new N

12
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,330
this one actually makes a larger portion
a by eight we've been using

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,832
so we're going to get bigger Pyrex dish
this time I practiced by spraying

14
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:38,250
non-stick spray

15
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:42,116
to nine by 13 and I also preheat the
oven to 350 degrees

16
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:47,111
so this is easy because it's all in one
large bowls the first week that two caps

17
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:51,109
a flower and again no flowers just
ground-up ok me on and

18
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,012
you can buy it at the store in that how
the section you can make your down by

19
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,064
grinding and and coffee grinder or

20
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:01,118
I in a blender sam skinner that in 2
cups

21
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:07,077
and I've got to skip 708 protein you can
use any flavor that you like

22
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:10,111
for me I just like for this year
ingredients the better because then it's

23
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:14,190
health you usually it takes a little
better to use it to skip to that

24
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:18,303
and then ima start putting in all their
free rein

25
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,580
ingredients I've got 2 teaspoons have
cinnamon

26
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:24,059
teaspoon and a half

27
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:29,114
as ground ginger half a teaspoon of
cloves

28
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:34,061
closer pretty strong but I think that's
really what gives a six-player

29
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:40,090
so this guy at teaspoon as at baking
soda and a teaspoon and baking powder

30
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,101
and a half a teaspoon

31
00:01:44,082 --> 00:01:47,156
at Salt for my sweet air

32
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:51,081
I'm actually adding and a half cup
others out of

33
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:54,460
you can use the brown sugar plan you can
use the regular I actually like the

34
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,100
brown sugar plans for this must be a lot

35
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,070
but you can always find it this means
just the regular have kept as I'll it

36
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,153
also

37
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:05,114
that in in except he's trying greens
really well

38
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:11,028
hey an end to this

39
00:02:11,028 --> 00:02:14,517
gonna start adding the wet ingredients
you can make these in separate bowls you

40
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,510
like but it's really not necessary

41
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,092
some skin put it all right in the same
for some

42
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:23,161
I'm gonna start with for egg whites you
can use the liquid egg whites if you

43
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:24,370
like

44
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:28,038
I used and regular real eggs can I like
those better for me

45
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:31,054
for baking but it's up to you nah man

46
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:35,783
half a cap on you can use whatever kind
you want you can directly or not he can

47
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,380

00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,087
an end to that man had

50
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:46,886
14 ounce as that ABC applesauce

51
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,750
you can use regular and sweet apple
sauce at home if you have that

52
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:55,024
that in the air comes out to probably
about a fourth undercut if you can use

53
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:55,790
the dryer at home

54
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,880
to that I'm gonna had my pumpkin

55
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:03,162
I've used a whole 15 ounce can pumpkin
for this Saeed you can use as little or

56
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:06,063
as much as you want I really like mine

57
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:10,982
really company so use the whole entire
can make sure to the pic

58
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,630
the ROP pumpkin and not be pumpkin pie
mix that's loaded with sugar

59
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:18,071
that in semifinal ingredient

60
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:24,092
is just two teaspoons vanilla so I've
got all those and

61
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,501
you can use the West if you like but I
don't make a mess so I'm just gonna

62
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:28,900
fault at all and

63
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:35,009
with a spatula homie

64
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:43,769
certainly come together for this recipe

65
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,030
you can use and that's or you can do
without nuts

66
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:51,962
I'm gonna put some on tax and I really
like pumpkin on it together

67
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,410
so I've got it all mixed up tonight that
I have to go on that

68
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,085
in a little baggie said there is no
dennis is because I didn't 5 a crash

69
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:00,434
that kinda an actual crush these myself

70
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
so I like to buy the ones from the band
usually they're a little bit more fresh

71
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,987
than the ones I've been sitting on a
shelf while

72
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,326
touched them in a bag you can grab
anything you like I like my little

73
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:11,570
rolling

74
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:16,125
10 just one expression a little bit if
you read about adding too much

75
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,134
that your dessert he actually don't have
to mix them and you can put it all

76
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,150
together and just maybe sprinkle half

77
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:25,066
on one side or and just lightly
sprinkling on top

78
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:28,140
I like to mix my name because I like a
City nets in every bank

79
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:33,048
it's totally up to you speak any

80
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:40,084
getting there maybe a little smaller 8
noticed and fees and

81
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:47,096
now the defense though with

82
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:51,115
if you make it with or without nuts with
natural looking at probably and

83
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:55,097
about 67 68 carries without nets you're
looking at

84
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:59,099
under fifty it's about forty seven
carries so it's totally up to you but

85
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,134
the fat isn't that dan

86
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,034
that different and the amount of protein
really isn't that different

87
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:08,070
it's like about four grams protein bar
this next 24 bars by the way

88
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:15,007
stuff got that on mixed and money get
money

89
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:19,062
fish rennie

90
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:26,062
just poured in pain

91
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,990
%ah spread out now this when you want to
take it for about

92
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,196
at thirty minutes I would say that it's
totally up to you some people like the

93
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:41,305
bars a little bit more

94
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,180
soft and some people like my little more
cooked through I suggest that if you're

95
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,024
traveling the peace

96
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:50,052
I'm definitely keep them in the oven a
little bit longer cuz you want in a hole

97
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:50,091
that

98
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:57,091
he's not have them

99
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,008
they get for about 30 minutes

100
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:10,075
that's right

101
00:06:10,075 --> 00:06:13,119
and then we'll check in about 30 minutes
always make sure when you're baking that

102
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:14,094
year

103
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:17,543
at the rack is like usually in the
middle it's too close to the heating

104
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,060
element on the bottom it'll burn

105
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,097
if it's too high at it'll take forever
to Kirk's our we will check on it in

106
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:24,076
about 30 minutes

107
