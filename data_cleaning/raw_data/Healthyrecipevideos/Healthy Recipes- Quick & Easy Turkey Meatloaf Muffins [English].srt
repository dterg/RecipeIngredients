00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,007
Hi I'm Jamie Eason
and I'm in

3
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,016
the bodybuilding.com
kitchen today

4
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,739
to show you how I make my
Turkey Meatloaf Muffins.

5
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:36,971
[music]

6
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,767
You're gonna need
a large bowl for this,

7
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:43,033
because we've got
a lot to mix up, okay,

8
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,767
but the nice thing is is just
one big bowl for everything.

9
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,166
Okay.

10
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,300
The first ingredient we're gonna
need is a cup of

11
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,537
quick-cooking oats.

12
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,843
So we're
gonna dump those in.

13
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,767
Then you've got all these
ingredients that we're gonna

14
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:56,774
mix in with it.

15
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,934
We've got
2 tablespoons of garlic.

16
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,967
Now, you can either use
the powdered version,

17
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:05,400
or you can use
the minced version.

18
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,006
I'll show you what--I've
got it over here.

19
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,008
Here's the minced garlic.

20
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,575
Now, this one seems to be okay.

21
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,333
If you read the ingredients,
it says, "Garlic, water."

22
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,867
It says, "Phosphoric acid,"
and no preservatives.

23
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,200
So this one's okay.

24
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,006
You could probably use this as
an option, but some of them,

25
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:21,340
be really careful.

26
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,266
Read the label.

27
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,667
They actually have oil in them.

28
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,000
It won't be real prominent.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,004
It won't say it on the top.

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,338
So you've gotta really
check out those ingredients.

31
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:32,233
This one's actually rare
to be just in water.

32
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,467
So that's an option, too, but
we're gonna use the powder

33
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:37,200
'cause it's just
as good that way.

34
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:42,269
Okay, then we've got
1 teaspoon of salt.

35
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:45,470
We've got 2 teaspoons
of pepper, black pepper.

36
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:49,769
We've also got 2 teaspoons
of a dry mustard...

37
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,834
just dry, yellow mustard.

38
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,333
And sometimes if you're
looking for dry yellow mustard,

39
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:59,000
some people will not be able to
find it in your standard jar,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,233
kind of like this one...

41
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,233
You'll have to find it
in sort of a box.

42
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:05,000
It looks a little bit
more like the pepper,

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,834
but it's in a darker box.

44
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,835
So I've noticed it's hard to
find sometimes, and that's why.

45
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:15,333
And then we've got
a half teaspoon of cumin.

46
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,100
Cumin is a really smoky spice.

47
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,534
It's really good for you.

48
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,300
A lot of these spices are
antioxidants so they're

49
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:22,336
really good for you.

50
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,633
If you're not using a lot
of spices in your food,

51
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:27,000
you should start doing so.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And then we also have
a half teaspoon of thyme.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,004
Thyme is used a lot

54
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,737
in poultry dishes,
whether you're making chicken,

55
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,667
turkey, or anything.

56
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:41,669
And then our last ingredient
is the one that makes

57
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:44,934
the whole dish, so this is not
the easiest to find,

58
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,133
so this might take
you a little while,

59
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,367
but it's very well worth it.

60
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,367
It is 2 teaspoons of
a chipotle pepper seasoning.

61
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:55,000
Here's--let's see
if I can find it.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,004
Here's what it looks like...

63
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,338
so hopefully you'll be able to find that.

64
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,734
It does add some
heat, so be careful.

65
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:04,767
If you're not big on hot things,
then maybe only add

66
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,000
a teaspoon and a half or
something like that.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,166
But I really think without it,
they're a little more bland,

68
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,300
so you definitely want
the heat in there.

69
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,370
So that's it.

70
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,669
So I'm just gonna use my
fingers and kind of get it all

71
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,834
incorporated and mixed up...

72
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:21,867
This whole recipe
is pretty much about

73
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,867
using your hands,
so all right.

74
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:27,333
That looks pretty good.

75
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,166
Oh, and before I
really get messy,

76
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,834
I'm gonna take this off...
So put that to the side.

77
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,300
All right.

78
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:36,470
The next thing we're gonna need
is going to be chopped onions

79
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,100
and chopped celery.

80
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,735
Now, this is pretty convenient
'cause it just comes

81
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,867
in the package
in your produce section.

82
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm all about quick and easy,
and this is what I'm gonna do.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,006
I hate chopping onions,
so we'll open that up...

84
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:53,972
and if you were to chop it,

85
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,033
you're gonna want
to do a cup of everything,

86
00:03:58,033 --> 00:03:59,400
so quite a bit.

87
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,837
You know, you really can't
overdo the vegetables,

88
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,200
and if you're not a fan of
celery, you can use red peppers,

89
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,010
green peppers,
anything you want.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,467
But celery and onion seem to
work really well for this.

91
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,471
But the more veggies you add,
the more moisture there's gonna

92
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:18,867
be in your dish, so overdo
the veggies instead of under.

93
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,400
Put that to the side.

94
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:22,637
All right.

95
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,100
The next thing we're
gonna need is meat.

96
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,003
Grab these over here.

97
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:32,370
For this recipe, you can either
use extra-lean ground turkey,

98
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:36,100
or you can use extra-lean
ground chicken breast.

99
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,003
Either one will work
really well, and actually,

100
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:44,008
even beef will work,
too, so get that open...

101
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:46,009
Dump it in.

102
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,742
And I'm using probably--I would
say this is about probably about

103
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,633
2 pounds of meat.

104
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:58,100
So dump that in, and it
doesn't have to be exact.

105
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,004
That's the great thing about
this recipe is you kind of do it

106
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,338
all to taste.

107
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,000
You just dump it all in
and see what you get.

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,033
Then the next thing we're gonna
need to add some moisture is

109
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,367
gonna be 3 egg whites.

110
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:13,367
If you're not concerned
about adding any added fat,

111
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:16,400
you can actually do a whole egg
in there, but for this purpose,

112
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:21,071
we're just gonna
use the egg whites.

113
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:26,934
There's one...

114
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:30,800
Egg number two...

115
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:38,300
and egg number three.

116
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:41,004
Now, before I really get
my hands in there and get dirty,

117
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:45,371
I'm gonna make sure first that
I have my muffin pan prepped,

118
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:50,166
and I've already set
the oven to 375 degrees,

119
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,767
so make sure you preheat it and
that it's ready to go before you

120
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,266
put them in.

121
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:58,567
Rinse my hands off.

122
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,233
All right, so we're
gonna prep this,

123
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,567
because I don't want to have to
stop it the middle with goopy

124
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,200
fingers and do it.

125
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:09,006
So I'm gonna use my canola
oil or olive oil spray,

126
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:11,006
and that is 12 muffin tins.

127
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:12,373
It should make about 12.

128
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,934
Sometimes it goes a little over.

129
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:19,100
It just depends on how big or
small you make them.

130
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,468
Okay.

131
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,575
You want to spray 'em pretty
good just to make sure they

132
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,233
don't stick.

133
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:33,233
And to save my pan, 'cause
I hate when they get gross,

134
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:37,233
I always, always, always
wipe the excess off the top,

135
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:40,400
'cause they will get pretty
grodey if you start making these

136
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:43,237
a lot, which is what I do,
because I always have these on

137
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,300
hand and in my refrigerator,
just ready to go.

138
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:48,537
You can actually keep this
recipe completely frozen in your

139
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:52,533
freezer and just take them out
one at a time and microwave them

140
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,542
if you want.

141
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,066
All right.

142
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:57,567
So that's ready to go.

143
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,900
I'm gonna set that to the side.

144
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,776
Bring this back and get busy.

145
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,266
So take any jewelry off.

146
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:09,200
This is pretty
cold...So all right.

147
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:13,636
Starting to look pretty grodey,
which is exactly what we want.

148
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:18,533
You don't want to over-mix
meat too, too much.

149
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:21,834
You do want to make sure you get
all the spices incorporated and

150
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:24,967
lift it up and get all
that stuff out of there.

151
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,974
If you over-mix meat, though,
it tends to get a little more

152
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:33,300
tough, so don't go crazy.

153
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:36,470
Just get it all in there.

154
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,633
Now, the nice thing
about this dish, too,

155
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:44,700
is that the muffin tins are what
keep it in its serving size.

156
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,141
So it's all nice and
portable that way,

157
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:50,567
and it's got your carb and
your protein all mixed in one.

158
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,600
Now, it is a low
amount of carbs,

159
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,039
so you could still
eat them in a pita.

160
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,640
You could add a few rice
cakes or something to them.

161
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,400
Every time I flip it,
I'm still seeing spices,

162
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:01,009
so I'm making sure.

163
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,442
All right.

164
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,734
Don't want to over-mix,
so I'll stop there.

165
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,233
All right.

166
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,600
Now we're gonna put
them in our muffin tin,

167
00:08:09,006 --> 00:08:14,006
and I'd say do about
a racquetball size.

168
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,539
Let's see.

169
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,133
That might be a little larger
than a racquetball size,

170
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:19,467
but not too bad.

171
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,800
We'll see how that looks.

172
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:22,008
Sometimes you'll get all the
way through and have to steal

173
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:27,875
a little from the other one
to kind of make 'em even out.

174
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,166
There we go.

175
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,133
You don't have to be perfect, but...

176
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,342
Another thing is
that the fact

177
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,667
that they're
in a muffin tin,

178
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,667
this is essentially
just a meatloaf.

179
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,670
The difference is most
meatloafs have, like,

180
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:48,266
a ketchup base kind of in them,
whether it's ketchup

181
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,934
or tomato sauce or something
inside of 'em.

182
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:53,667
We've kind of left that
out and just put the eggs

183
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:58,400
and a lot of veggies in there,
so they're not quite as moist.

184
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,471
You can, if you want to, you
can actually do what I call

185
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:02,872
a thumbprint.

186
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:06,266
Push it down in the middle and
put like a ketchup or a barbecue

187
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:08,767
sauce or something in
them if you want to.

188
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,100
They get a little slimy and a
little bit messy to take with

189
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:14,334
you, so only do that when
you plan to eat 'em at home,

190
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,433
I think.

191
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:17,900
Okay, we're doing good.

192
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,876
Not looking like I'm
overdoing it yet.

193
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,433
Oh, the beauty of having
them in a muffin tin,

194
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,667
not only is that it's
the right portion,

195
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:31,533
but the moisture from
the veggies stays confined in

196
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,000
the little tins,

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,003
so it tends to keep the
meat from getting overly dry.

198
00:09:36,003 --> 00:09:39,270
Because, you know, extra-lean
ground turkey has no fat really,

199
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:45,500
so really kind of just gets
overcooked pretty easily.

200
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:50,240
There we go.

201
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:54,767
Exciting stuff
watching me do this, I'm sure.

202
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,100
Okay, it looks like I actually
maybe have--I can make them

203
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:02,034
a little bit bigger, so make the
last one and then we'll add

204
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,734
a little bit to a few of 'em.

205
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:08,433
Now, if you were to cook
these and measure them out,

206
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:12,934
they would usually be about
2 and a half ounces each,

207
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:16,700
so that will come to, you know,
a pretty good serving size.

208
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:21,440
Like, a male might eat maybe
three or four of these,

209
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:25,934
where a female would only eat
two would be your serving.

210
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:29,533
And each one of these, depending
on how large you make it,

211
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:35,400
is gonna be like about 78
to 80 calories, or you know,

212
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:38,770
maybe a little more if
you do too large of ones.

213
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,800
These might be more like 80,

214
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,942
'cause I'm making 'em
pretty big.

215
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:47,567
I think those packages, I didn't
check the exact weight of them.

216
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,567
May have been a little bit more
than 2 pounds, but that's good.

217
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,571
I'd rather have more than less,
and these are really lean,

218
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,834
so they'll be good for us.

219
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,633
So that looks pretty good.

220
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,900
Rinse it off.

221
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,776
And so to continue with
the macros, about 80 calories.

222
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,333
Maybe like 2 grams of fat.

223
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,967
You're looking at 4 carbs
and about 11 grams of protein,

224
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,934
and that's for one muffin.

225
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:16,934
So you can get 22 grams
of protein for 2 muffins.

226
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:18,266
All right.

227
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:23,900
These are ready to go,
looking pretty good.

228
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,013
Stick them in the middle rack,

229
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:29,736
and we want to cook
these for quite a while.

230
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:33,867
You never want uncooked turkey,
and so depending on how hot

231
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:36,700
your oven gets, I'm gonna
put mine at about 40.

232
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,011
But you might have
to play with that.

233
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,668
Go a little over,
go a little under,

234
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:44,433
and just check
them as you go.

235
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,767
All right.

236
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:48,633
So we've got 40 minutes to
wait, so go watch a sitcom

237
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,767
or something and we'll
come back and check 'em.

238
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,333
All right.

239
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,266
I think these are about
done, so check 'em out.

240
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,600
They're looking good.

241
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:00,839
Let's pull 'em out.

242
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:05,834
They smell good.

243
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:09,867
I'll put down my potholder so
that I don't burn the counter.

244
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,700
So they look pretty good.

245
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:12,340
All right.

246
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,100
Now we just need to
give 'em time to cool.

247
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,009
I suggest that you take them
out a little bit before they're

248
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,175
completely cool and put
'em on a paper towel.

249
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:24,567
I just fold it up on the counter
and I put 'em on there and allow

250
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,600
the juices that have kind of
accumulated in the bottom to get

251
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:30,639
a little bit dry, so that I
can put 'em in a Ziploc baggie,

252
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:34,237
keep 'em in the fridge for any
time that I just need to grab

253
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:38,800
something to go, or just looking
for something good to eat.

254
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,012
So hopefully you like the
Turkey Meatloaf Muffin,

255
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:43,435
and hopefully you'll come back
