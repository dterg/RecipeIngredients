00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,167
Hi.
I'm Jamie Eason.

2
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:21,167
Welcome to the
bodybuilding.com kitchen.

3
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:24,000
Today I'm gonna make my
Pumpkin Protein Bars.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,133
I know I've been making a
whole lot of different types

5
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,967
of protein bars, but I don't
want you to get burned out

6
00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:29,700
so I've got this brand new one.

7
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:31,014
This one actually makes a larger
portion than the 8x8 we've been

8
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:35,337
using so we're gonna get a
bigger Pyrex dish this time.

9
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,200
I've prepped this by
spraying non-stick spray.

10
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:41,335
It's a 9x13, and I've
also preheated the oven

11
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:42,539
to 350 degrees.

12
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,133
So this one's easy because
it's all in one large bowl.

13
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,067
See, first we've got
2 cups of oat flour.

14
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:52,700
Again, oat flour is just ground
up oatmeal, and you can buy it

15
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,012
at the store in
the healthy section.

16
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,635
You can make your own by
grinding it in a coffee grinder

17
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:58,838
or in a blender.

18
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,334
So I'm just gonna put that in.

19
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,000
Two cups.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And then I've got 2 scoops
of a vanilla whey protein.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,633
You can use any
flavor that you like.

22
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:10,300
For me, I just look for the
fewer ingredients the better

23
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,003
'cause then it's healthier
and usually it tastes a little

24
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:12,011
better too.

25
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,734
So 2 scoops of that.

26
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,835
And then I'm gonna start
putting in all of the flavoring

27
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:18,042
ingredients.

28
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:21,467
I've got 2 teaspoons
of cinnamon,

29
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,275
1 1/2 teaspoons of
ground ginger,

30
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:30,767
1/2 teaspoon of cloves.

31
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,434
Cloves are pretty strong, but I
think that's really what gives

32
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:35,167
this its flavor.

33
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:39,733
So then we've got a teaspoon of
baking soda and a teaspoon of

34
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:44,737
baking powder and then
1/2 teaspoon of salt.

35
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:51,733
For my sweetener, I'm actually
adding 1/2 cup of Xylitol.

36
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,200
You can use the
brown sugar blend.

37
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:54,069
You can use the regular.

38
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:57,100
I actually like the brown sugar
blend for this recipe a lot, but

39
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,068
you can't always find it.

40
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:01,800
This one is just the regular
half cup of Xylitol so put that

41
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:02,975
in.

42
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,769
I'm gonna mix up these dry
ingredients really well.

43
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:09,673
Okay.

44
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,100
And then to this I'm gonna start
adding the wet ingredients.

45
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,134
You can mix these in separate
bowls if you like, but it's

46
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:17,867
really not necessary so I'm just
gonna put it all right in the

47
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:19,200
same bowl.

48
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,835
First thing, I'm gonna
start with four egg whites.

49
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,474
You can use the liquid
egg whites if you like.

50
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:26,633
I used regular, real eggs.

51
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:30,600
I kinda like those better for
baking, but it's up to you.

52
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,013
Then I'm gonna add
1/2 cup of almond milk.

53
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,570
You can use
whatever kind you want.

54
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,873
You can do regular milk.
You can do rice milk.

55
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,100
Whatever you'd like, but
I like the almond milk

56
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,768
so 1/2 cup of that.

57
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,874
And then to that I'm gonna add
one 4 ounce of the baby food

58
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,567
applesauce.

59
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,833
You can use regular unsweetened
applesauce at home if you have

60
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,867
that.

61
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:52,867
Put that in there.

62
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,300
It comes out to probably about
1/4 cup if you're gonna

63
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:57,070
us the jar at home.

64
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,733
To that I'm gonna
add my pumpkin.

65
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,733
I've used a whole 15 ounce can
of pumpkin for this so you can

66
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,740
use as little or as
much as you want.

67
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:08,433
I really like mine really
pumpkiny so I use the whole

68
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,067
entire can.

69
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:13,069
Make sure, too, that you pick
the raw pumpkin and not the

70
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:16,400
pumpkin pie mix
that's loaded with sugar.

71
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:17,371
So put that in.

72
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:22,600
Then my final wet ingredient is
just 2 teaspoons of vanilla.

73
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,433
So I've got all of those in.

74
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,567
You can use the whisk if you
like, but I don't wanna make a

75
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:30,575
mess so I'm just gonna fold
it all in with my spatula.

76
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:43,400
Okay.
Starting to come together.

77
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:46,737
And for this recipe, you can use
nuts or you can do it without

78
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,133
nuts.

79
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,139
I'm gonna put
some walnuts in it.

80
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,000
I really like pumpkin
and walnut together.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,667
So I've got it all mixed up.

82
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,233
I've already put 1/2 cup
of walnuts in a little baggie.

83
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,237
So the reason I've done this is
because I didn't buy the crushed

84
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:58,642
up kind.

85
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,700
I'm gonna actually
crush these myself.

86
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,174
So I like to buy the
ones from the bin.

87
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:05,867
Usually they're a little bit
more fresh than the ones that

88
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:06,872
have been sitting on
the shelf for a while.

89
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,600
So I just put them in a bag.

90
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,014
You can grab anything you like.

91
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,837
I like my little rolling pin.

92
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,500
Just sort of crush
them a little bit.

93
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,638
If you're worried about adding
too much fat to your dessert,

94
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,700
you actually don't
have to mix them in.

95
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,574
You can put it all together and
just maybe sprinkle half on one

96
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,600
side or just lightly
sprinkle them on top.

97
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,173
I like to mix mine in because I
like there to be nuts in every

98
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,400
bite, but it's
totally up to you.

99
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,676
That's pretty good.
Getting there.

100
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,576
Maybe a little smaller.

101
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:46,300
Alright.
Now I'll just dump these in.

102
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,011
Now the difference though--if
you make it with or without

103
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:52,001
nuts--with nuts, you're
looking at probably

104
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,368
about 67, 68 calories.

105
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,533
Without nuts, you're
looking at under 50.

106
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,267
It's about 47 calories.

107
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:02,000
So it's totally up to you, but
the fat isn't that different and

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,005
the amount of protein
really isn't that different.

109
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,008
It's like about 4 grams
of protein a bar.

110
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,014
This makes 24 bars, by the way.

111
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:13,013
So I've got that all mixed in.

112
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:20,670
And I'm gonna get my dish ready
and just pour it in the pan.

113
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,436
Okay.
I'll get it all spread out.

114
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,733
Now this one you wanna bake it
for about 30 minutes I would

115
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,735
say, but it's totally up to you.

116
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,767
Some people like the bars a
little bit more soft, and some

117
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,800
people like them a
little more cooked through.

118
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:46,375
I suggest that if you're
traveling with these,

119
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,633
definitely keep them in the oven
a little bit longer 'cause you

120
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,635
want them to hold up.

121
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,835
Put these in the oven.

122
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,011
Bake it for about 30 minutes.

123
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:10,867
Think that's right.

124
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:11,874
And then we'll check
it in about 30 minutes.

125
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:15,800
Always make sure when you're
baking that your oven rack is

126
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,275
like usually in the middle.

127
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,200
If it's too close to the heating
element on the bottom, it'll

128
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:19,011
burn.

129
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:23,001
And if it's too high up, it'll
take forever to cook so we will

130
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,734
check on it in about 30 minutes.

131
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,233
Alright.
The timer went off.

132
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,234
Let's check our bars.

133
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,500
Alright.
They look good.

134
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,972
I'm pretty sure these are done,
but if you wanna make sure you

135
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,469
can stick a toothpick in it.

136
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,400
If it comes out dry with no
wetness or anything, it's pretty

137
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:50,004
much ready.

138
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:53,037
So I'm gonna let these cool and
then we'll come back, cut them,

139
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,167
and I'll show you
how to wrap them up.

140
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:55,173
Okay.

141
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,300
Our Pumpkin Protein Bars are
fully cooled so I'm gonna cut

142
00:06:58,003 --> 00:06:59,436
them up.

143
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:00,667
Let's see.

144
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,833
We've got--it's gonna make 24
squares so I'm gonna make 3 cuts

145
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:13,767
lengthwise and 5 this way.

146
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:31,233
Alright.

147
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,233
Scoop a few of these out.

148
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:34,942
They look really good.

149
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:39,967
You can see some of
the nuts in there.

150
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:42,008
And then I'm gonna
wrap up the rest.

151
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:45,241
Show you how I wrap
them when I travel.

152
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,700
Be sure to store these in a
cool place like the frigerator

153
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,010
because if you leave them just
out on the counter or not in

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,003
your cooler,
they'll actually spoil.

155
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,010
There's no preservatives
or anything in these.

156
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,440
I do them by twos.

157
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:07,100
I just place two on the saran
wrap, fold over the one end, and

158
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:10,006
roll it over, and then fold
in the edges and--it's pretty

159
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,773
simple.

160
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:11,900
Okay.

161
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,876
I'm gonna finish up
wrapping up the rest of these.

162
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:16,233
