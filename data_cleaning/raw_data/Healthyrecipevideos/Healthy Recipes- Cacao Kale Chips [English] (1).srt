00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,636
on okay so today I'm here with more rain
andrea

2
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,840
my client worrying and her daughter
she's ten-years-old Rens 38

3
00:00:26,084 --> 00:00:30,943
and so we're going to be doing I kale
chips Cacau kale chips this is my little

4
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,290
I'm phenomenal recipe that I develop so

5
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:38,228
they're just grabbin two bunches I have
kale chips

6
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,790
ararat organic kale and

7
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,448
taken off leave spine and here so I'm
gonna let them work away at that

8
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,201
so kale is a super-fit you know people
always ask what the server so there

9
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,250
isn't one super food but this definitely
is a very nutritious food

10
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:58,030
and it's got a lot of phytonutrients
disease-fighting properties which is

11
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:58,814
what we what

12
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,577
so Cacau kale chips again to punch is a
kale we've got coconut oil to get

13
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:08,130
another oh I love your choice you could
do even an hour but I'll if you want I

14
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,042
have almond meal as well

15
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,159
that I have some stevia and organic
cacao powder that they're gonna be

16
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,940
mixing and so with kale chips a lot of
times

17
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:20,119
I see people on social media postino
that they put him in there off and put

18
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,008
them at 350

19
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:26,250
that is a choice for you you can do that
for about 10 or 15 minutes however

20
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:29,214
I'm gonna tell you the importance of why
getting a dehydrator

21
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,464
is gonna actually help with getting
those nutrients and so I have my

22
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,380
excalibur which santa brought to me two
years ago

23
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:40,084
and i thankful for that up the parts of
the hydrator is it doesn't kill the

24
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:43,793
enzyme and I'm the enzymes are so
important because it keeps the nutrients

25
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,616
alive the whole reason we're eating
vegetables

26
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,237
I'm is because I've the the powerhouse
foods that they are

27
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,446
so when you're cooking them above a
certain level you're actually killing

28
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:54,883
all the nutrients

29
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,590
so again I'm 40 years old I didn't have
all these tools when I was in my

30
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,084
twenties or thirties

31
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:03,143
so it's you know over time I've made an
investment in certain pieces of

32
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,121
equipment that actually helped by

33
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,520
