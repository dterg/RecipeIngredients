you how to make my world famous

5
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:30,041
ten-minute talk house well before I get
started I just wanna give you a rundown

6
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,640
on what the ingredients are

7
00:00:34,064 --> 00:00:38,393
so very simple we're starting out with
some grilled chicken breast

8
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,067
K I'm going to be topping my tacos with
some shredded lettuce

9
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:46,956
some salsa could use a little black
beans

10
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,420
and low fat shredded cheese and just as
a side

11
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:54,941
I've got some brown rice okay we also
are using

12
00:00:55,319 --> 00:01:00,325
white corn tortillas I love these guys
I'm gonna garnish with fresh lime and

13
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:01,382

22
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:32,142
I help fill the time exercise a lot so
salty not going to kill me

23
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:36,088
for my clients you have high blood
pressure then that's a different story

24
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:39,093
so we've got to soften their always on
the go with the face

25
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:42,462
fresh cracked pepper this chicken breast

26
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,450

34
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,102
you watch when you're really quick I'm
sorry guys but you can't

35
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,007
cross-contaminate

36
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:21,012
very so when you touch me

37
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:24,061
you always want to wash your hands with
hot soapy water because

38
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:26,116
cross-contamination can be found in the
kitchen

39
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:31,079
I mean it season infinite using the
packet of taco seasoning that's fine 30

40
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,138
min preservative I mean you some fresh
spices

41
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:37,112
just a little paper Rica just sprinkling
you don't have to get outta

42
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:41,043
measuring spoon this is some chili
powder

43
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:44,054
and if the start smoke I love I

44
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:47,473
some cayenne pepper I'm crushed red
pepper

45
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,280
and a little bit acumen human is a

46
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:54,063
price that you will see a lot in Spanish

47
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:57,069
and Latin cooking were smoking

48
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,147
ok local I literally because it is 3

49
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:06,061
made chicken breasts I'm just gonna cook
it for just like

50
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:11,132
a minute just to get the spices on it
and also when you heat a fight

51
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:15,035
that lets the favor release so kinda fun

52
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,067
kinda cool smells good

53
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:23,166
and I think that this chicken breast
looks pretty year with the spices on it

54
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,788
alright I'm turning off my heat I'm
moving my pan over

55
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,190
let that cool off yet

56
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,090
despite not making a cop in fact it how
it happened now

57
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:43,033
what i do. in time to get my party is
ready now if you have a gas range at

58
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,045
home you just turn on your he

59
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:48,061
kinda too low

60
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,132
throw the forty a right over it feel
pray you don't really fit the courts

61
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:53,131
here right over it

62
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:57,036
if you don't have a gas stove at home

63
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:00,128
you have an electric stove that little
like oil you looking think

64
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:04,112
heating elements as they call it you can
put it on that issue

65
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:09,023
medium-high just make sure that it's
clean it's not like coated with like

66
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:15,092
picky like three weeks from yesterday or
something and you just leave it on there

67
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,760
and then I hope every healthy

68
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:21,485
coke at home has a set up wrong because
we don't you go buy some

69
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,560
like a dollar at Target K go get
yourself some tongs

70
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,095
because you can use those to flip over

71
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:31,166
yours for Kia's user for a lot

72
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:37,130
but the stimulus for tortillas just get
some fire on this

73
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:42,028
look at how free that is just like a
Martha Stewart

74
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:46,093
photo nothing to the day when I'm done
with these for Macon so pretty that

75
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,102
Martha will be proud

76
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:52,041
okay there

77
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,116
almost done and you know it you if you
don't have to if you don't like heating

78
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:56,112
them on your union

79
00:04:57,012 --> 00:05:01,031
heating element on your stove on your
gas range you can always just my boy

80
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,190
I'm not a big fan microwave but last
case is in re: a worst-case scenario

81
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:12,103

116
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,008
get this one like that

117
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:29,080

cayenne pepper

126
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:05,135
peppery guys chili powder you should go
get some because it really

127
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:10,089
makes the food taste good okay it makes
the taste phenomenal and I think

128
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,158
that we not only do we like good tasting

129
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:18,111
is that as humans we eat with our eyes
so we want the food to look pretty

130
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:23,075
as well and just because it's healthy
does not mean have planned

131
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:26,111
and not fun okay this

132
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:32,012

side for a little bit more are

138
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:52,100
piece of those are only about 10 to 12
grams carbohydrates for

139
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:56,147
540 s cell that's why we're adding a
little bit more black jeans and brown

140
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:57,092
