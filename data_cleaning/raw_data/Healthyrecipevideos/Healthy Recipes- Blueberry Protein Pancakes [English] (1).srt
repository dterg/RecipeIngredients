00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,080
i'm natalie happen here today in the
bodybuilding not come kitchen

2
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:19,017
funny how to make a recipe that I meet a
lotta morning and free blueberry protein

3
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,171
him this is a really good recipe for
getting tired of the same ol

4
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:26,072
egg whites and health this is the exact
same

5
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:29,640
ingredients just mixes them into a
different way I know that a lot of

6
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:32,490
protein pancake recipes out there but

7
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,048
I like this one because it uses all
Whole Foods and it is really a

8
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,790
you hear all the ingredients are going
to use for today's recipe

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,121
bring you think that way and a half a
cup

10
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:48,110
a old-fashioned outs and with all
passion and it's better than the ins and

11
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,007
outs just because they're a little bit
less processed in finance have actually

12
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,102
been cooked

13
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:56,095
and dehydrated to make them cook faster
and these have just been

14
00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:01,100
world we have for the couple very you
can use fresh or frozen

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,011
where you can substitute it for
raspberries or strawberries

16
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:09,013
we have a half a cup unsweetened vanilla
almond milk

17
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,630
and just makes her that when you get

18
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:16,120
the almond milk you're getting the
unsweetened vanilla kind I like the

19
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:17,093
island breeze friend at forty calories

20
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:21,107
has no sugar in it and you also if you
wanted you could substitute not but I

21
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:22,086
prefer

22
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:25,174
almond ok and then we have one teaspoon

23
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:29,089
have baking powder this is just to help
the pain keeps rising a little bit

24
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,112
two packets of true we have this is to
make them a little bit leader

25
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:38,036
have half a couple unsweetened
applesauce in the gases in a min

26
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:41,065
and those two items were gonna stay to
the end and use it as a topping on top

27
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:41,154
of the pancakes

28
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:45,122
for these last few extra innings the
blender to mix everything together

29
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,086
and I'm gonna start with my liquid
ingredients me

30
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:55,134
porn my almond milk and then I'm going
there

31
00:01:56,034 --> 00:02:01,083
to my egg whites I'm

32
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,118
can attract these right into the blender
now

33
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:09,020
some people just so they re ok so way
into the trash can actually like to put

34
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,063
mine in the garbage disposal

35
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:14,089
and I found out the hard way I used it
for my ex into the trash can in

36
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:17,175
when any I came home in me house not
really bad I couldn't figure out why

37
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,141
and it's because I love the oaks in the
trash can for too long

38
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:29,041
and so now what i do. as I'll just put
them right into the garbage disposal

39
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:33,006
some people like to feed their egg yolks
to their

40
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:36,081
dog and I guess helps with their coat

41
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:43,126
makes it a little bit shy near you
missed some really good breakfast recipe

42
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,031
if you have kids

43
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,035
I have a 2-year-old and he loves this
rescue even a couple times

44
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:53,145
a week and it's a really good way to
incorporate from whole grains into their

45
00:02:54,045 --> 00:02:54,102
diet

46
00:02:55,002 --> 00:03:00,033
and the blueberries have some really
good anti-oxidants another thing you can

47
00:03:00,033 --> 00:03:01,115
do is you can make these in book

48
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,044
on the weekend and then free zone

49
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:08,055
I think that is a little bit better
fresh but you definitely can freeze them

50
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,148
and when I do that I just put them in a
ziploc bag and then

51
00:03:12,048 --> 00:03:19,048
I wanna eat them i suck my grief for
about a minute alright

52
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:23,131
we have some pics a quiet their names
can add me

53
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:29,035
both even gonna save the blueberries
until we're actually in the gravel

54
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:33,109
at my baking powder just gonna do you

55
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:38,016
gas assault probably find a 8:30 soon if
you were to measure

56
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:41,060
and into packets of trivia if you

57
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:44,055
132 pancakes without any apple sauce on
top

58
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,034
you could add a third Paco trivia and
make your pancakes sweet see you would

59
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,042
need to add apple sauce on top

60
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:54,055
and then I'm scrambling this really fast

61
00:03:54,055 --> 00:04:01,055
share

62
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:11,005
me

63
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:15,060
quickly gonna turn my skill onto about
medium-high heat

64
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:19,091
and I'm just gonna spray it with a
little bit us nonstick cooking spray

65
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:23,081
man

66
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,082
was gonna take my pattern and

67
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:29,178
this recipe makes two pancakes you can
takes is one serving so

68
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:37,078
usually just kinda eyeball it input
about half a battery in the skillet

69
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:40,148
and then I meant a calf my blueberries
and just drop them

70
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:46,079
in the top you can blend these the
blueberries into

71
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,138
if you want I've done that before but I
think it is a little better this way mix

72
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:51,040
in a little bit juicier

73
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,081
so we're just gonna let this Kirk usual
you can tell they're ready to flip

74
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:58,124
when there's bubbles in the center the
pancake I want him fucking cake we've

75
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:01,052
been talking about one to two minutes on
each side

76
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:05,116
in for the first pancake doesn't flat
quite as well the second game cake

77
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:09,016
and it's because something from the
blender the egg whites tend to

78
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:13,038
or chemist at the top in the oath fall
to the bottom but this one turned out

79
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:13,091
pretty good

80
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:16,099
I'm just gonna king cake and

81
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:21,072
put it on my plate who

82
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:25,130
at five not quite as pretty and then

83
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:30,036
I'm gonna go ahead and put me second
pancake and I'm just gonna plan that for

84
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,144
just the second circuit everything

85
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:39,044
she cannot spring with Hannah spray

86
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,106
up understand pour the rest my batter in

87
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:53,013
actually get all those boats out

88
00:05:53,013 --> 00:06:00,013
an address my will vary

89
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:06,707
emerges through it took about 12 minutes
per side you know it's ready to flip

90
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:10,310
once the edges look like they're cooked
all the way through and there's bubbles

91
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:12,140
for uniform in the center and the
pancake

92
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,990
so we are done cooking our second
pancake

93
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:22,099
go ahead and put it on the plate as you
can see this is a lot of food this is

94
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:27,012
another reason I like this recipe is cuz

95
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,065
through a great way to start the day
with a knife hurting now

96
00:06:30,065 --> 00:06:33,124
and then the pixar release we are on
their own

97
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:37,068
I think and so what happened actually
eat these even without any

98
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:41,094
applesauce on top you can use sugar free
syrup if you want but

99
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,186
I prefer to stay away from that just
because I have a lot of preservatives in

100
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:44,385
it

101
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,210
so sometimes if I want a little extra

102
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,740
something on top are you some
unsweetened applesauce just make sure

103
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,102
you get the applesauce but

104
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:56,301
says no sugar added or unsweetened

105
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,325
we're here eating green list the only
ingredients are Apple's water and maybe

106
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,630
ascorbic acid which helps keep the
coloring so I'm just going i the

107
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:10,134
half a cup about off of things going for
it on top

108
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:16,077
sometimes I like to in a little bit
underneath and then

109
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:19,526
I like cinnamon so I'm gonna put a dash
of cinnamon on top you don't have to you

110
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:21,460
then if you like cinnamon

111
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:24,090
sprinkle a little cinnamon on top

112
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,998
there you go you're a really good
breakfast one serving is to pancakes and

113
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,180
serving have six a white

114
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:35,057

solid oak forget that we were a protein
