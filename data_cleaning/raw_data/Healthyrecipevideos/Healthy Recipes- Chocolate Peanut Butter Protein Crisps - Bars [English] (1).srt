00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:22,054
showing

9
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,633
you had a mi my chocolate peanut butter
protein Chris

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,790
in a previous video I showed you how to
make my honey almond protein Chris

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,173
but now we're going to use to my other
favorite ingredients chocolate

12
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:39,086
and peanut butter so let's get started
the ingredients for chocolate peanut

13
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:40,094
butter protein Chris

14
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:43,108
are three cuts ever crispy brown rice

15
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,987
we've got one cat a whole it's and sq

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,110
other than no a protein powder we've got
some crushed almonds 7

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,107
seen a better rate here some cocoa and
some

18
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,070
brown sugar and somewhere and you have
got mahany

19
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,081
thats I can name so let's get started to
start

20
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:07,099
I for it three caps at the crispy brown
rice and just CC

21
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,180
you can't have a reference this is the
crispy brown rice a year its

22
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:15,063
and gluten free organic it's got very
few ingredients in it does have a little

23
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:20,093
bit a sugar its natural sugar its target
Lassus and evaporated cane juice but its

24
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:23,168
two grams per serving this before so the
company serving so

25
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:27,161
you've got less than five grams if
natural sugar in the whole entire espy

26
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,067
said not bad

27
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:34,103
and it makes 18 servings so we started
with that but that in and I've got my

28
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:38,162
cat the whole its that on top

29
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,246
and then I'm gonna add 1/4

30
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,670
cat as crushed almonds so if you don't
have pressed are means you can actually

31
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:47,726
just

32
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,420
taker an ominous you know about a fourth
a couple dozen just beat him with a

33
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:52,921
rolling pin

34
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,880
you can ease the back a pot what every
whatever you have and then on top of

35
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:57,687
that

36
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,640
I'm gonna had once keep vanilla whey
protein powder

37
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:04,083
I can I sprinkle out on top. spread it
around a bit

38
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,744
now do not mix this up we don't wanna
make

39
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,532
and all that protein powder settle to
the bottom so I just committed to shake

40
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,230
anonymous edits aside

41
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:17,059
ok set now miss so it's out to

42
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:21,208
a smaller bowl and in this call now make
sure you use an

43
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,640
a glass wall that's important because we
need to put it in the microwave so

44
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:28,102
and we're gonna start out with our main
ingredient which

45
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:33,004
is an all-natural insulted creamy peanut
butter

46
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:37,813
you can use twenty if you like but the
20 actually doesn't seem to accept quite

47
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:38,390
as well

48
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,090
but have media and an anti-skid really
good too so it's just your preference

49
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:46,010
there's a lot a natural oil that comes
up from the peanuts so we're gonna for a

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,068
little bit

51
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:50,142
that of don't pour it all out though
because you really have a hard time

52
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,054
nixon at

53
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:55,136
so I'm gonna go ahead in makes it see it
sorry kinda hard

54
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:59,385
see get the muscle in there

55
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,750
mix it up a bit I A

56
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:07,129
and so where you actually take and three
forces a cat

57
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,094
the creamy on natural peanut butter and
add that to the bowl

58
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:15,120
so I like to use my little smaller skip
I think it's more manageable but you can

59
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:19,050
use a measuring cup in just measure to
three-fourths so

60
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:22,093
I'm going to skip it how up

61
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:26,161
noon this month slightly chunky slightly
smears so

62
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:30,150
I think I needed to may be stirred up a
little longer sometimes have been known

63
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:34,009
to heat it up a little man in the
microwave just to get going but

64
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:38,063
cease we've got r1 force go in

65
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:45,095
smaller

66
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:48,143
and your have to be super super on

67
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:52,054
careful with the measurements in this
actual recipe

68
00:03:52,054 --> 00:03:55,129
you can add a little take away a little
if you want I've actually figured out

69
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,050
the ratios just to have just enough so
you don't have to you

70
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,028
and emailing it to dry wanted to stick
together a bit

71
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:06,752
we're trying to make that crispy rice
and everything can all come together

72
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,484
so that when we freeze a actually makes
this crunchy crispy

73
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,070
kinda granola honest Carolina this is
more challenging than

74
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:22,034
then on better now with that said you
could use the allman better if you'd

75
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:22,039
like

76
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:27,120
and you can actually add extracts so if
you wanted to make say chocolate was

77
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:28,083
like a little bit

78
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:34,024
orange 10+2 orange or something or
there's coconut extracts there's been an

79
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,027
ass maybe chocolate peanut butter banana
might be pretty good

80
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,099
you can actually use little he sees a
banana if you'd like to you but

81
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:44,099
they will get a little mushy and I don't
their make it not stick together as well

82
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,133
season sparingly

83
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:50,040
or do the drive finance but again
there's added sugar should just be

84
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:52,055
careful about how much do you think is
where are you using

85
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,186
I did the natural sugar mixing in at its
gonna be my honey

86
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:59,455
said we're gonna do

87
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:05,970
half a cup honey so since this is my 1/4
measuring skip 72 eighties

88
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,124
sitka one no

89
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:13,077
spatula

90
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:17,138
now honey is really really really good
for you I'm often asked about

91
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:21,047
honey verses agave NIS agaves better

92
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:24,134
I personally prefer honey I think and
there's so many

93
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,069
health benefits to it with their
anti-oxidants and

94
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,418
it's good for your skin and it's getting
into bacterial there's just so many

95
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,490
great things about it

96
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:36,083
I'd prefer to use it cuz I got the
interest it

97
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:40,542
it'll still spike your blood sugar so be
careful because a lot of times and some

98
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:43,336
others labels can be misleading you make
you think that

99
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,778
that's a better choice but and actually
still payments to the same thing

100
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:53,020
so alright we've got those two greens in
a bowl and now I'm gonna add

101
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,094
Africa actually as is out all brown
sugar blend

102
00:05:56,094 --> 00:06:00,323
and Allah Ta'ala is a sweet it comes
from rank raspberries plans it's a

103
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,200
natural fit tests

104
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,520
sweetener and it's actually sugar
alcohol its

105
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:08,231
does not have quite as many calories as
regular sugar

106
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,770
but it still will have a slight insulin
spike it's just a little bit there for

107
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:14,096
you it is organic it is natural

108
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:17,131
and they actually use it in toothpaste
it's good for your teeth so

109
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:22,040
read em that in and the brown sugar part
adds a little bit have a molasses flavor

110
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,583
to it we're making

111
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,280
and if you really prefer you can look
for something right

112
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:31,037
organic second I which and it has 15
carries for

113
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,088
per teaspoon issue adding some calories
but it's less

114
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,527
sweetness as far as like whiskey and
sugar they also tasteless

115
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,590
the same I and that having he's more so
for me I just like to use this

116
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:45,125
and just kinda it's mainly SAV re: into
that

117
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:49,087
and when and as you've got the now I am

118
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:55,136
miss you X he stands in our

119
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:59,124
and then I'm going to add my chocolate
now the chocolate

120
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:04,091
the preferences that to you can add a
couple people sneaking and

121
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,570
allotted tablespoons you can use dark
chocolate Hershey's chocolate

122
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,190
whatever kind you'd like to use some
people like how you can use

123
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:15,308
anything you'd like so open at

124
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,479
st3 in those I prefer for the recipe to
use dark chocolate

125
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,660
so if you can find the NC in dark
chocolate

126
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:29,165
i think thats play your best bet so I
Minister this set just a little bit

127
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:33,111
just to get the dry stuff incorporated a
little

128
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:37,066
and then we want to stick this in the
microwave for just about thirty seconds

129
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,695
just kinda soften it up so i cant

130
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:47,289
can stir it all together ok

131
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:54,068
that

132
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:57,118
ok me

133
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:03,103
sternest together a bad up

134
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:11,003
unit all unduly dry ingredients
incorporated in still help

135
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:15,107
so doing pretty well you might have to
stick in there for

136
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:19,009
and maybe another 30 seconds to really
get it 5-all

137
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:23,028
and i think im gonna do that with when
you add all the cocoa and everything

138
00:08:23,028 --> 00:08:24,067
it's it's not quite

139
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,156
as and liquefied is when the other
espy's at remain like their honey

140
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:31,095
on protein Chris so let me stick it back
in

141
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:34,118
for 30 more seconds don't do you the
minute

142
00:08:35,018 --> 00:08:38,020
all at once because you could burn your
chocolate and we definitely don't want

143
00:08:38,002 --> 00:08:45,002
that

144
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,165
sternest together there

145
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:58,093
up yes

146
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:01,144
much easier to stir sound now that I've
got it all out

147
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:05,049
I'm gonna go ahead and poor that on top
a very dry ingredients

148
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:12,094
here again aspirin smells really good

149
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:18,042
he prolly just eat the chocolate and
peanut butter but

150
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:23,056
see

151
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:28,104
its this and I don't share with my dog
his

152
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,046
ski have chocolate said I'm gonna fall

153
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:36,113
the dry ingredients over the top I like
to do the little folding technique is it

154
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:37,061
keeps

155
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:40,153
I spatula from getting too sticky right
off the bat

156
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:48,053
very and it does on place might see you
have to really work it to start getting

157
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:52,056
all their wedding greens incorporated
into the dry

158
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:55,091
I sent might take a little but a little
work a little bit a muscle

159
00:09:55,091 --> 00:10:00,106
so I think Obama's get it all done

160
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:04,007
he can see the protein powder still in
there

161
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:07,078
get probably keeps turning Cecchin

162
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:11,173
Sam keep down a second it might look a
bit dry

163
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:15,096
you don't wanna adalat a liquid though
because if you do

164
00:10:15,096 --> 00:10:18,110
and it'll in that going to use often
fall apart

165
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:22,090
so I think it looks pretty good now

166
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:25,147
and we in that thing this in the freezer
so it can be hard but

167
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:30,053
do you know that after while if you take
out the freezer its gonna get softer and

168
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,103
softer and it still tastes awesome

169
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,095
she's not quite the same texture because
of course the peanut butter and

170
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,140
everything softened up a little bit

171
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:40,095
to think we're good all

172
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:44,109
even I'm gonna show the first in four is
how I make

173
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:50,051
like when the shapes I Brian just a
little circle

174
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:54,124
that's pretty easy one demonstrator and
if I can you don't need a pep you can't

175
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,062
do anything he just use your

176
00:10:56,062 --> 00:10:59,067
feel circle and then he's really take a
little

177
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,102
take a little bit you fingers push it
down in New

178
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:06,066
takes little the time

179
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:10,092
it's really pretty pretty simple and
then you just wanna firmly pack it in

180
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:10,163
there

181
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:15,140
energy push it all an then just hit me

182
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:19,050
cannons take the little leap of

183
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:23,088
you can see how it turns out turns out
that my heart is at

184
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:26,115
it stays that way and it's really nice
compact pneumatic its staff come

185
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:28,088
together in mathematics you'd like

186
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:35,088
so need another one of those maybe
alternate flavors do one kind is

187
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,097
Chris and do a different kinda favorite
Chris

188
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:44,174
me

189
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:50,113
pac spending make it a little bit nearly
go

190
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:54,095
so I would fill up the mess in the tray
and then stick that in freezer

191
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:58,188
and I'm gonna finish working on these
ever I had left him and put in here and

192
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:04,151
a commitment

193
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,125
okay the chocolate peanut butter protein

194
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:15,025

we're going to get take that app

195
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,049
daily create at to get the ones that we
cut into shapes

196
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:22,106
so now they're nice in frozen and solid
Sarah

197
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:28,023

actually keep it in 20 days

198
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:33,023
it makes about a serving 18 for single
serving in these are looking at 153
