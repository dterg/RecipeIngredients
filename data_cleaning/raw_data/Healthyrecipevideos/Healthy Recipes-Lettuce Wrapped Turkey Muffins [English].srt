00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,375
Hi guys, Jillian Beck back
with another healthy recipe

2
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:07,292
with Bodybuilding.com.

3
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:09,367
Today I'm gonna be showing
you my lettuce-wrapped

4
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:11,833
turkey muffins.

5
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,792
I know there are a lot of
turkey muffin recipes out there.

6
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:16,500
This is just my version.

7
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,588
It's pretty simple.

8
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:20,792
It's very versatile so I'm just
gonna show you how to put

9
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:23,208
it together, give you
some different options,

10
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,875
but you can play around
with it and we'll get started.

11
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:29,500
It should take about
25 minutes to make altogether

12
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,213
with the baking.

13
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:34,783
It's gonna be in the oven for 20
minutes at 375 and then it takes

14
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,533
about 5 minutes just to
throw everything together.

15
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,583
So what you're gonna
need is our ground turkey.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,458
I usually go 96% and above.

17
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:49,042
Right now I think
this is 96% lean.

18
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,000
If I'm closer to like a
show or a photo shoot,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,208
I definitely go leaner, 99%
is what I usually go with.

20
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,208
So I got this.

21
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:01,042
I basically just went through my
fridge since we're doing kind of

22
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:04,067
mid-week meal prepping at our
house and kind of just grabbed

23
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,333
whatever veggies I had in stock.

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:11,358
And so we have some spinach,
some bell pepper and some onions

25
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,458
and then I usually like to
throw in like a fresh herb.

26
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:17,667
I've done fresh basil, I think
that was last week and this week

27
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,875
I'm gonna do some
fresh cilantro.

28
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:22,500
So those are the veggies
we're gonna use to throw in

29
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,713
with the ground turkey.

30
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:28,542
You'll also need one egg
white and then our seasonings.

31
00:01:28,542 --> 00:01:32,500
And I like to use
Bragg's liquid aminos.

32
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,713
It's a natural soy
sauce alternative.

33
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:40,233
I go with my staples of
seasonings which is garlic,

34
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:44,463
ginger and then a little bit
of sea salt and cracked pepper.

35
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,875
And then you'll need some
cooking spray for our muffin tin

36
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:51,750
and then some romaine lettuce
leaves like for the hearts to

37
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:53,080
wrap the turkey burger
or turkey muffins in.

38
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,483
So it's really
simple, really easy.

39
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,000
I've got the
turkey already in here.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,083
I've chopped our veggies up
so I'm just gonna go ahead

41
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,875
and add those.

42
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,583
And so you don't
have to like stick with

43
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,375
the exact veggies that I do.

44
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,750
Definitely play around with what
you like and what you have

45
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,242
in your fridge at the time.

46
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:18,083
We're gonna
throw that in there.

47
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,750
There's kind of the
staples we have around.

48
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,158
If we have some green onion,

49
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,858
I like to throw
that in there as well.

50
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,792
If I want them spicy,
I put in some chili flakes.

51
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:35,000
These are just gonna be pretty
standard and they're just great

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,875
to have on hand during the week.

53
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,833
You know, for quick lunches,
you can break them up

54
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:44,042
and put it over brown rice
if you want some carbs.

55
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:46,208
If we have them for dinner, I
usually just wrap them in the

56
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,792
romaine lettuce leaves and so
they're really good that way.

57
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:54,750
And then I put some mustard or
Walden Farms like barbecue sauce

58
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,158
is amazing so I
like that as well.

59
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,917
I'm gonna add my
one egg white here.

60
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:07,292
And some turkey muffins call for
like quinoa flour or out flour

61
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:10,125
to help bind
everything but like I said,

62
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,417
mine's pretty simple, basic.

63
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:15,708
I don't have a ton of
ingredients and so it's just egg

64
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,833
white, turkey and veggies and I
like to keep it simple that way.

65
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,208
So I'm adding these spices and
I don't really measure them, but

66
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:27,042
I would say maybe it's like 1
teaspoon, but I just kind of go

67
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:32,458
with eyeballing it since
I do this all the time so.

68
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:36,463
And then for the liquid aminos,
I would say 1--let's see here,

69
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:43,292
1 teaspoon about so.

70
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,708
We'll mix all these
ingredients together.

71
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,713
You can get in there with your
hands too and really make sure

72
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:54,167
everything is combined well.

73
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:59,708
I'm just using this
wooden spoon here.

74
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:06,500
It's almost ready.

75
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:09,047
It's kind of just
a different version

76
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,000
of the turkey burgers
that I make.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,042
So when I want to do turkey
burgers like if we're having a

78
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:18,583
barbecue or, you know, and I
want to make my own burgers,

79
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,292
I'll do turkey burgers with
a recipe very similar to this

80
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,250
but I'll make patties and I'll
grill them up and then wrap

81
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:25,030
them in butter leaf lettuce.

82
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:28,242
But these muffins are just super
easy, especially when you're,

83
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:32,542
you know, in the kitchen so much
and doing a lot of meal prep.

84
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:38,250
So, I just wanted to keep it
simple and healthy for you guys.

85
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,233
So that's all mixed.

86
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:45,458
I'm gonna ahead and spray
the muffin tin with this Pam.

87
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,417
Good to go.

88
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,333
I'm gonna use a spoon here too.

89
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,375
I'd say it's like a baseball
size for each muffin

90
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,000
and we'll just
pop that in there.

91
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:10,422
And so if you want to find out
kind of like what your macros

92
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:16,083
for this meal are, definitely
what I do is take like two

93
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,250
muffins and put it on the
scale and kind of measure it

94
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,608
out and see what I'm at.

95
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,708
I usually try to go for
3 to 4 ounces of protein

96
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:27,375
and that's usually about
200 calories or less.

97
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:30,250
I mean it's all just
veggies in here so it's not

98
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,983
a whole lot of anything else.

99
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:38,000
So depending on what your
macronutrient needs are, you can

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
have two or three, you know,
turkey muffins or more than that

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,792
if you're trying to put on
some more size or muscle

102
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:52,333
and you need a higher
dose of protein so.

103
00:05:52,333 --> 00:06:02,417
Almost ready here.

104
00:06:02,417 --> 00:06:11,708
And that made
perfect 12 muffins.

105
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,708
Put that back on here.

106
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,083
Sit that aside.

107
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,708
My hands are really gross
right now so I'm gonna go

108
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:29,875
rinse them real quick.

109
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,950
Okay, so here
are our turkey muffins

110
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,833
before they go in the oven.

111
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,625
So I'm gonna go ahead
and put them in there at 375

112
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:42,083
for 20 minutes
and I will be right back.

113
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:50,708
All right, guys, so the
turkey muffins are done.

114
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,833
They've baked for about 20
minutes at 375 and I went ahead

115
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:58,167
and let them cool off
for about 2 minutes or so.

116
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,172
And I've taken out the romaine
lettuce hearts and I placed

117
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,958
two muffins on there,
if you can see them.

118
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,833
And--I guess you
can't but they're there.

119
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,958
And I'll go ahead and probably
put some spicy mustard on there.

120
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,333
If I'm getting a little
crazy with it, I might add some

121
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,792
avocado, which will be a really
excellent choice, especially for

122
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:22,208
dinner time if you're, you know,
omitting like any other carbs

123
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,208
and you want to add
some extra fats,

124
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,167
sliced avocado on these
would be excellent.

125
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,792
So yeah, I might do some
spicy mustard and avocado,

126
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,458
but again it's your choice.

127
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,483
You can add
Walden's barbecue sauce.

128
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,713
Some low-sugar
ketchup would be good.

129
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,750
So feel free to
make it your own.

130
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:42,150
It's really simple,
really quick and delicious.

131
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,880
