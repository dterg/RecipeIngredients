Hi, I’m Eugenie. 

2
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:21,093
Today I’m so excited because I’m making a delicious dish, Jjangjangmyun, 

3
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:25,099
which is one of the most popular Korean dishes. 

4
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,101
It’s a Koeanized Chinese dish. 

5
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,116
For this recipe you will need: 

6
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:36,100
pork, black bean paste, potato, onion, zucchini, vegetable oil, sugar, 

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
cornstarch or potato starch, minced garlic, and oyster sauce.

8
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:47,041
First, heat a large deep frying pan over medium high heat.

9
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:52,058
And add in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, 

10
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:55,112
today I’m using grape seed oil.

11
00:00:56,012 --> 00:01:02,012
And add in 2 garlic cloves, minced. 

12
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:06,082
Then add in 5 ounces of pork. 

13
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:12,082
Normally pork is used for jjajangmyun, and I am using pork tender-loin. 

14
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:23,007
And season with salt and pepper. 

15
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:31,078
And cook for about 4 minutes. 

16
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:38,085
Then add in 1 medium potato, diced. 

17
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:44,111
I’m adding in potato first because it should be cooked thoroughly. 

18
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:51,011
And cook for about 3 minutes. 

19
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:55,132
And 1 medium onions, roughly chopped. 

20
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,125
I know it’s a lot of onion. 

21
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:05,025
Jjangjangmyun at restaurants has a lot of onions. But of course adjust the amount as you like.

22
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:11,015
And 1/3 medium zucchini, diced.

23
00:02:11,078 --> 00:02:17,078
Then stir fry for another 3 minutes. 

24
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:23,016
And make a hole in the center of the frying pan. 

25
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:29,016
And I will add in 3 tablespoons of chunjang, black bean paste.

26
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:34,129
Without black bean paste, you cannot make jjajangmyon.

27
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,082
3 tablespoons.

28
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:43,082
And 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon of sugar. 

29
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:52,012
And stir to fry making a little circle for about 2 minutes. 

30
00:02:54,058 --> 00:03:00,058
This is very important because Jjangjang means fried sauce in Chinese.

31
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:09,035
And mix all together until the veggies are well covered. 

32
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:17,065
Hm, it smells good. The fried sauce.

33
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:24,074
Then add in 1 and 1/3 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of oyster sauce. 

34
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:35,076
Oyster sauce will give rich flavor to jjajang.

35
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:39,106
And bring it to a boil.

36
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:41,035
And in a cup, 

37
00:03:41,035 --> 00:03:47,035
add in 2 tablespoons of cornstarch 

38
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:54,004
and the 2 tablespoons of water 

39
00:03:55,011 --> 00:04:01,011
and mix all togther until well mixed.

40
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:07,086
Don’t add the cornstarch directly to the pan, it won’t dissolve very well.

41
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:10,013
Ok,

42
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:14,161
Now add in the boiling jjajang sauce.

43
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:20,145
And bring it to a boil 

44
00:04:21,045 --> 00:04:27,045
And reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce is thickened.

45
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:35,061
And now for the noodle.

46
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:39,076
Cook fresh noodle according to the package directions. 

47
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:45,076
Any noodles will do but fresh Chinese style noodle is the best for Jjangjangmyun. 

48
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:54,002
And if you want Jjangjangbop, just serve with rice instead of noodle. 

49
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:59,116
And drain the noodle and wash with cold water. 

50
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:05,112
Be careful because it’s very hot.

51
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:12,012
Voila! And sauce. Jjajangmyon. The noodle with hot jjajang sauce. 

52
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:20,099
Jjajangmyon is better with cucumber, danmuji, onions, and vinegar.

53
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:32,002
Bon appetit. 

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is why I love fresh noodle.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,025
And black bean sauce is really intense and bold.

56
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:54,025
This is absolutely a must dish for Korean food lovers and curious people.

57
00:05:57,041 --> 00:06:03,041
And I have many delicious Korean recipes in my “foods in Korea” playlist. 

58
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:11,007
Thank you for watching. See you soon. Bye.
