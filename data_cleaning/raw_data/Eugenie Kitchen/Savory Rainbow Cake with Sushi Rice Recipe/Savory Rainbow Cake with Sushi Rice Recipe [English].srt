00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:18,095
Hi, I'm Eugenie. Do you eat rainbows? 

2
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:21,144
Today I'm making rainbow sushi rice cake. 

3
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:24,128
It's totally healthy and very yummy. 

4
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:29,049
If you make savory cakes, try this.

5
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:30,128
For this recipe you will need: 

6
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:32,099
cooked short-grain rice, 

7
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,101
rice vinegar, 

8
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,027
optional sesame seeds, 

9
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,101
mayonnaise, 

10
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,022
canned tuna, 

11
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,127
salt, sugar, onion, 

12
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:44,120
pepper, red bell pepper, carrot, 

13
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:51,002
boiled eggs, broccoli, and red cabbage.

14
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:55,073
First, in a mixing bowl I’m adding 6 ounces of drained canned tuna, 

15
00:00:55,091 --> 00:00:58,092
1 tablespoon of finely chopped onion,

16
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,003
 and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise. 

17
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:03,091
And mix to combine. 

18
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,098
This is for rice cake filling. 

19
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:09,124
And season with pepper.

20
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:12,103
You can use crab or salmon salad. 

21
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:18,016
If you are vegetarian, how about guacamole? 

22
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:20,018
In 3 tablespoons of rice vinegar, 

23
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:22,094
add 1 tablespoon of sugar 

24
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:24,102
and 1 teaspoon of salt. 

25
00:01:25,074 --> 00:01:27,146
And stir to combine. 

26
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,055
And pour it into the cooked short-grain rice and fold to mix. 

27
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:38,065
Be careful not to break rice. I cooked 2 cups of rice today. 

28
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:43,086
And if you want, now mixing in toasted sesame seeds would be great. 

29
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:49,016
Then equally divide the rice in 5.

30
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:52,025
And add one vegetable in each bowl: 

31
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:55,066
3 tablespoons of finely chopped red bell pepper, 

32
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:58,073
3 tablespoons of finely chopped carrots, 

33
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:03,128
crumbles of 3 boiled egg yolks, 

34
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:07,057
3 tablespoons of finely chopped broccoli, 

35
00:02:07,057 --> 00:02:12,066
and 3 tablespoons of finely chopped red cabbage. 

36
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:18,066
I used blanched broccoli, carrot, and red cabbage for better taste, digestion, and color.

37
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,107
And mix well. 

38
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:31,079
For vegetarians, how about yellow bell pepper or yellow pickled radish for yellow rice? 

39
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:36,136
Any other ideas? Leave a comment below.

40
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:40,108
Then for a rainbow cup, make a rainbow in a glass. 

41
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:42,037
First, violet. 

42
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,099
And I will add tuna salad between layers. 

43
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,128
Then green, 

44
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,062
yellow, 

45
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:54,081
press down a little with a spoon to make it firm.

46
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:57,083
orange, 

47
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,006
and red.

48
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:05,112
And for sushi rice cake, make another rainbow in a cup lined with plastic wrap. 

49
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:08,061
This time I started with red. 

50
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:14,061
And repeat the process. 

51
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:21,084
Voila, Healthy rainbow cup. 

52
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,014
And rainbow sushi rice cake. 

53
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,132
Aren’t they beautiful? 

54
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:30,041
The colors of this dish is  so inviting.  

55
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:36,041
Bon appetit.

56
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:37,153
I love it.

57
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:41,029
Also it’s healthy. 

58
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:44,075
The main flavor is tuna salad filling. 

59
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:48,100
So make sure to use your favorite delicious filling. 

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can find the recipe down in the description box. 

61
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:58,099

62
00:03:59,053 --> 00:04:02,065
And this week I have Facebook giveaway. 

63
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:08,065
The prize is an organic matcha which is number 1 bestseller at Amazon.com and bubble tea cups. 

64
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:15,015
To enter this giveaway, just LIKE the giveaway post. That’s it. 

65
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:21,015
Some people can’t find matcha easily and it can be pretty expensive for such a small amount. 

66
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:28,046
And this giveaway is perfect for my green tea Frappuccino. 

67
