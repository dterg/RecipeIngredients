Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

2
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,027
Today I'm making watermelon cookies. 

3
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:24,020
Those cookies are really easier than you think and it takes only several everyday ingredients. 

4
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:30,002
It's basically a French biscuit sable recipe which is a slightly modified version of my French coffee sables.

5
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:37,157
First, in a mixing bowl, I will add in ½ cup of softened unsalted butter 

6
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,140
and 1/3 cup of granulated sugar. 

7
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:46,007
And whisk until light and fluffy. 

8
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:51,061
And add in 1 egg yolk. Remaining egg white will be used later. 

9
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:57,066
And add in ½ teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and a generous pinch of salt. 

10
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:02,108
And whisk until homogenous. 

11
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:09,008
Now sift in 1 and ¼ cups of all-purpose flour and fold until combined.

12
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,082
Now divide the batter into half.  

13
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:25,082
First I will make red dough by adding some red food color and kneading. 

14
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:41,019
This method is called 'fraiser' and you can mix without making the dough too tough with this method. 

15
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:51,024
And make a 2 inch diameter cylinder and cover with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator.

16
00:01:55,098 --> 00:02:01,098
Then take out half of the remaining vanilla dough and cover with plastic wrap. 

17
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:05,090
Then roll out. 

18
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,051
And chill in the refrigerator.

19
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:12,103
And with the remaining dough make a green dough. 

20
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:19,003
Today I'm using both matcha, Japanese green tea powder, and green food color. 

21
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:25,098
And again I will knead until homogenous and cover with plastic wrap. 

22
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,007
Then roll out. And chill in the refrigerator.

23
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:42,101
Now bring red dough and vanilla dough to working surface. 

24
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:49,073
Measure the size of the red cylinder and cut out the sides of the vanilla dough 

25
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:55,070
and roll out to lengthen it. 

26
00:02:55,007 --> 00:03:00,020
And place the red cylinder over it and carefully roll up like a yoga mat. 

27
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:04,083
Now cut off the surplus vanilla dough. 

28
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:10,083
Repeat with the green. 

29
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:17,041
By the way the cookie dough should be cooled a little before rolling, otherwise the dough will be too soft and won't hold the shape well.

30
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:32,087
Now cover the dough with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.

31
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,044
Now make a colored sugar. 

32
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:43,007
In a plastic bag, add in a little bit of green food color and spread with fingers to avoid any green color lumps.

33
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,100
And add in sugar and mix well until homogenous. 

34
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:54,086
This is a simple way to make colored sugar at home. 

35
00:03:54,086 --> 00:03:59,170
And make a sugar bed. 

36
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:06,007
Then break one egg white and brush on the cookie dough. 

37
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:14,011
And roll the dough over sugar bed. French sable cookies need sugar decoration.

38
00:04:15,066 --> 00:04:21,066
And slice the dough half inch thick. And arrange the disks on a cookie pan. 

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,082
And decorate with toasted black sesame seeds. 

40
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:34,174
I love the mixed flavor of green tea and sesame seeds. 

41
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,076
But if you don't have sesame seeds, use mini chocolate chips. 

42
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:43,128
Again I will chill the pan in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes 

43
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:50,028
and then bake in the oven preheated to 350 degrees F. (175 C) for about 10-12 minutes.

44
00:04:53,007 --> 00:04:59,007
Out of oven immediately cut the cookies in half and let cool for 5 minutes. 

45
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,051
Then transfer to a wire rack.

46
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:05,034
Voila! Watermelon cookies. 

47
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:08,094
They are so so cute! I love them. 

48
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:12,157
It's French sable cookie style, so there are little cracks. 

49
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:19,057
Bon appetit. My dad really like sable cookies and I also love those crumbly biscuit sables!

50
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:30,115
