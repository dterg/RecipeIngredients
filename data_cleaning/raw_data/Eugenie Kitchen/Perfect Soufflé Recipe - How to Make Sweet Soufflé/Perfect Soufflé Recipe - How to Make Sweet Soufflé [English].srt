00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:07,093
Hi, I am Eugenie.

3
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:11,102
Today I am going to make "Soufflé à la vanille",

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,922
vanilla Soufflé.

5
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:17,770
Soufflé, it puffs up in the oven

6
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:19,134
and it falls down so quickly.

7
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:22,122
So, there is a famous French saying,

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,111
“Le souffle n’attend pas,

9
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,026
on attend le soufflé.”

10
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:33,055
That means le soufflé doesn’t wait for
us,

11
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:40,055
we (the guests) wait for le soufflé.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,932
But today we will not wait for le soufflé,

13
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:50,589
we will make 
the soufflé.

14
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:53,749
For this recipe, you will need:

15
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,773
1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (14g),

16
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,028
1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour ( 10g),

17
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,370
1 /2 cup of milk (120 ml),

18
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:03,576
1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract,

19
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,570
2 tablespoons of caster sugar (30g),

20
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:10,119
2 eggs, and a pinch of salt.

21
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:11,115
First,

22
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:13,089
with butter at room-temperature,

23
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:16,164
brush the ramekins.

24
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:19,121
Brush from bottom upwards.

25
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,104
This will make the soufflé to rise evenly.

26
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:29,041
Then, with caster sugar coat the ramekins.

27
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,104
And shake out any excess.

28
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,025
And set aside.

29
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,067
On medium heat,

30
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,071
add the butter in the sauce pan

31
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:39,071
and melt it.

32
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:39,132
Add in the flour

33
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,124
and with a wooden spoon

34
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:47,116
stir for about 1 minute.

35
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:48,100
In the microwave,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,082
I made the milk hot.

37
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,086
Out of the heat,

38
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:57,103
gradually add hot milk,

39
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:03,044
and stir until smooth and combined.

40
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:04,108
Back to medium heat

41
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:10,177
stir constantly until it comes to a boil.

42
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,268
Remove from the heat.

43
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,450
The texture should be like this.

44
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,420
This is white sauce.

45
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:23,331
Now add in salt and vanilla extract

46
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,784
and stir until combined.

47
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:30,512
Separate the egg white and egg yolk.

48
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,086
Then add in the egg yolks one by one into
white sauce

49
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,032
and stir to combine.

50
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:42,920
The sauce pan is still warm,

51
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:45,097
so pour the sauce into a separate bowl

52
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:50,031
to prevent unwanted evaporation.

53
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:51,730
And set aside.

54
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:54,131
Now, whisk egg whites.

55
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:56,130
It is not mixing.

56
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,465
It is incorporating the air

57
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:02,057
like this.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,947
Keep whisking until firm peaks form.

59
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,906
Add gradually sugar while slowly whisking.

60
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,600
Keep whisking until soft peaks form.

61
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:17,290
This is French meringue.

62
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:21,043
It takes about 20 minutes with hand.

63
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:26,115
Then, add about one third of the French meringue
into the white sauce

64
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:30,434
and whisk until homogeneous.

65
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,578
Then, pour all white sauce into meringue

66
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,370
and whisk until just combined.

67
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:46,656
Now, spoon the mixture into ramekin.

68
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,810
Run thumb around inside of the rim.

69
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:54,159
This will help the soufflé to rise straight.

70
00:03:55,059 --> 00:04:02,059
Bake at 390 degrees F (200 C.) for 12 to 15
minutes

71
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:08,010
or until very well risen.

72
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,006
Immediately serve on a plate.

73
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:13,590
And dust with confectioners' sugar.

74
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,118
soufflé...

75
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,745
Risen straight and evenly.

76
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,360
And it has golden brown top and pale yellow
inside.

77
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:28,995
This is classic French soufflé.

78
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:32,210
It is very delicate and hot mousse.

79
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,105
Thank you for watching!

80
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:37,017
Bye for now.
