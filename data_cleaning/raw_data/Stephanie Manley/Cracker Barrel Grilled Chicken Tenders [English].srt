Thank you for joining me here on Copycat Recipes.
Today I'm going to show

2
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,059
you how to make Cracker Barrel chicken tenders.
They are really easy to

3
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:28,163
make and they're going to taste just like
they do in the restaurant, and

4
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,155
they have just four simple ingredients in
them. Let me tell you what's in

5
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:33,088
them.

6
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:36,140
We're going to have chicken tenders in here.
Now if you don't have chicken

7
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:41,062
tenders, you can use a boneless skinless breast.
Just cut it up into strips

8
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:45,139
that are about one-inch wide and those will
be perfect. We're going to use

9
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,091
Italian dressing, any brand will do. Honestly,
don't spend a lot on this.

10
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,093
Just buy what's ever on sale. It's going to
be great.

11
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:58,073
We're also going to use a little bit of honey
and a couple of limes for a

12
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:02,104
little bit of citrus zest. We're going to
mix up the marinade. We're going

13
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,018
to marinade these chicken tenders for about
an hour. Then we're going to

14
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,116
cook them and they'll be perfect and they'll
taste just like they do in the

15
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,107
restaurant.

16
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,042
So we're going to begin by making the marinade
and this is really, really

17
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:21,042
easy to do. You are going to take one lime
and slice it, and we're just

18
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,440
going to go ahead and squeeze the lime into
our container. Now, I am mixing

19
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:33,086
my marinade in the same container that I'm
going to marinade the chicken

20
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:40,086
in. That way I can save a dish. Be on the
lookout for any seeds, just in

21
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:50,006
case that they come in. You're going to need
about a tablespoon of honey.

22
00:01:50,024 --> 00:01:55,035
Then you're going to need about half a bottle
of the Italian dressing. This

23
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:58,067
is a 16 ounce bottle. So we're going to use
about half of this for the

24
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,146
marinade.

25
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:07,495
Italian dressing, you can marinade anything
in it. Vegetables, steaks, all

26
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,992
kinds of stuff. All right. So I'm going to
give this a quick little stir.

27
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:19,739
Then I'm going to simply put my chicken in
here. Now I have about a pound

28
00:02:27,097 --> 00:02:31,144
of chicken in here. If you have a little bit
more, that'll be fine. We're

29
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:35,119
going to marinade the chicken now. Now marinade
only works for the first

30
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,115
time. So after we finish cooking the chicken
you need to discard the

31
00:02:40,015 --> 00:02:41,098
marinade and don't use it again.

32
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,122
So we're going to give this a quick little
shake. Put this in the fridge

33
00:02:45,022 --> 00:02:47,511
and we're going to come back in an hour and
we're going to show you how to

34
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,700
cook these up.

35
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:51,102
All right. So our chicken has been marinating
for just about an hour and

36
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:55,874
it's time to go ahead and cook it. Now, I'm
just using a regular skillet,

37
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,250
just a nice large flat bottom skillet. I'm
going to stick a little bit of

38
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:04,634
oil in the bottom of the pan. You can use
olive oil, vegetable oil, it

39
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:11,859
really doesn't matter. You want to let this
get a little bit warm. And

40
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:15,078
remember for when it comes to this chicken
marinade, don't use it again.

41
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:20,153
It's for one time only. You can see it smells
really good right now. And we

42
00:03:21,053 --> 00:03:28,053
will begin cooking it in just 

43
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:34,440
a second.

44
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:38,069
Okay, so we're going to begin cooking the
chicken. Our pan is hot now. So

45
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,144
you're just going to shake off the marinade
here and just drop it in the

46
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:50,044
pan. You're going to need to cook these on
a medium, medium high heat for a

47
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:57,106
couple of minutes on each side. It's not going
to take any time at all.

48
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:05,006
All right, now that I've put all the chicken
in the pan, you don't want to

49
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:13,612
crowd it, you want to give it a little bit
of space so it cooks nice and

50
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,639
evenly. Be sure to discard the fork that you
use for the marinade and get

51
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,350
another one. We don't want raw chicken to
contaminate anything else, so

52
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:30,108
it's a clean fork right here. These are again,
going to take about two to

53
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:34,097
three minutes on each side and we're going
to have perfectly cooked Cracker

54
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:35,130
Barrel chicken tenders.

55
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:40,057
So you're going to know the chicken is starting
to cook, if you look on the

56
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:43,136
side of the chicken you'll see that it's starting
to turn white. This will

57
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:47,099
help you know that the chicken is actually
cooking. No one likes raw

58
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:53,048
chicken. So go ahead and make sure your chicken
is cooked thoroughly. So my

59
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:56,034
chickens not yet ready to turn over just yet.
So I'm going to put it back

60
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:03,180
down and wait another minute or so and it
should be nice and brown.

61
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:08,087
You can see this chicken is just starting
to brown nicely, so I'm going to

62
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:15,087
go ahead and flip it. Okay, you can see this
chicken is wonderfully browned

63
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:34,033
now. We're going to go ahead and take it out
of the pan here. This stuff is

64
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:45,087
great on salads. You might just want to make
some up. Serve it on a plate

65
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:50,334
with a couple of vegetables and you have dinner
that didn't take too long

66
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,090
at all. You could marinade this before you
leave for work or even the night

67
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,882
before for a little extra flavor.

68
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:05,900
And here you go. There are some wonderful
Cracker Barrel chicken tenders.

69
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,040
So we've just made the Cracker Barrel grilled
chicken tenders. That was

70
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,780
really easy. It just took four ingredients.
