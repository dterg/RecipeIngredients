Hi, this is Stephanie Manley with CopyKat.com.
Don't you just love Cracker

2
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,056
Barrel's fried apples? Well, guess what? I'm
going to show you how to make

3
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:20,525
Cracker Barrel's famous fried apples, at home
and in your own kitchen. All

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,105
right, so I'm just finishing chopping up my
apples. You can make this

5
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,793
recipe with about five or six apples. My recipe
calls for either butter or

6
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:31,248
bacon drippings.

7
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:37,670
Now the Cracker Barrel doesn't use bacon drippings
in theirs, but you know

8
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:40,686
what? This tastes really good with bacon drippings,
and that's how my

9
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:47,332
grandma used to do it, so I can testify that
that makes them very, very

10
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,250
tasty. This recipe just has a few ingredients
in it. That's about five or

11
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:58,025
six tart apples, some brown sugar, a little
bit of nutmeg, some cinnamon

12
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:58,143
and lemon juice.

13
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:03,087
So after you finish slicing up all of your
apples, you want to keep them a

14
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:06,186
nice pretty color, so we are going to add
just a little bit of lemon juice

15
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:12,111
to this, and give it a stir before we take
this over to the stove and start

16
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,077
cooking our fried apples. Okay, so we're going
to get started on our

17
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,086
apples. We're going to take our butter and
melt that in the bottom of our

18
00:01:19,086 --> 00:01:19,142
skillet.

19
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:23,139
Again, you can go ahead and use bacon drippings
if you happen to have bacon

20
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:30,120
drippings. It'll taste just as good. I'm going
to let that butter get nice

21
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:35,064
and melted, and next I'm going to add my apples.
I'm just going to pour

22
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:39,163
them evenly on the bottom of my skillet. I'm
cooking these on a medium

23
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:43,063
heat, not too high, and not too low.

24
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:48,081
I am using an all-clad skillet here, but you
know what? I've seen many

25
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:52,430
chefs use far less expensive skillets, so
I think any skillet will really

26
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,000
do. In fact, an iron skillet will be great
for this as well. All right, so

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,056
my butter is all nice and melted right now,
and the apples are just

28
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,150
beginning to release some of their juices.

29
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:13,005
So now we are going to sprinkle in our brown
sugar, so we've added in our

30
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:23,269
brown sugar, it's just beginning to melt.
I am going to add in my cinnamon,

31
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:30,028
and I am going to add in a little bit of nutmeg,
and I'm just going to stir

32
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:43,669
to incorporate. These smell just incredible.

33
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,425
Now this butter and brown sugar is going to
make a really, nice, thick

34
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:59,019
syrup, so these apples will fry in syrup,
and the butter. It's going to

35
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,088
take about 15-20 minutes for these to finish
up. Then we'll come back, when

36
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:07,250
they're all nice and done. All right, so we're
about halfway cooking these

37
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:12,694
apples, and you can see we have this wonderful
thick syrup right here.

38
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,998
So while these are cooking, just be sure to
stir them every couple minutes.

39
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,070
You're going to have some fabulous fried apples,
so now you know how to

40
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:27,015
make Cracker Barrel fried apples, but you

wonderfully, creamy, syrupy sauce

45
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:50,280
is all over these apples. They're nice and
soft now and they're going to

46
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:57,028
taste just great! We're going to give this
one a try, so good. Hi, I'm
