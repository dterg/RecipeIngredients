This is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.
Today I am going to show you how

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,913
you can make Ro-Tel Cheese Dip in two different
ways. This is one of my

3
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:18,276
favorite party foods to make. It is easy and
tastes great. Again, I said

4
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,490
this is easy. This only has two ingredients;
the first being Velveeta

5
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:26,088
cheese and the next being a can of Ro-Tel
tomatoes.

6
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:32,124
Now the ratio is easy, easy to remember, it's
one pound of Velveeta cheese

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:38,055
to one can of Ro-Tel tomatoes. Now I like
to heat mine up on the stove,

8
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:42,086
just because I think it's easier than pulling
it in and out of the

9
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:45,137
microwave, and stirring it and trying to make
sure it's all perfectly

10
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:47,476
melted.

11
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,891
This takes only about three to five minutes,
and you will have some

12
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:58,727
perfectly made Ro-Tel dip. So again, there
it was. That took me about three

13
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,960
to five minutes to make, and now I'm going
to spoon this up and put it in a

14
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,181
dish and get it ready.

15
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:11,120
So but you know what? While this is really
good, we can make this Ro-Tel

16
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:16,066
Cheese Dip better. So I'm going to show you
how you can jazz up your Ro-Tel

17
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:23,084
cheese dip; sausage. You're going to brown
a pound of sausage, so go ahead,

18
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:29,066
and cook that thoroughly, because we are going
to put this into our cheese

19
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:34,103
sauce, so you want to make sure it is completely
browned all the way

20
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:35,088
through.

21
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:42,088
So again, I'm starting out with that same
pot of Ro-Tel dip and that is one

22
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:49,098
pound of Velveeta to two cans of Ro-Tel. I'm
adding in sour cream, cream

23
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:56,111
cheese and the next ingredient I am going
to add in is that sausage. That

24
00:01:57,011 --> 00:02:00,053
cooked sausage is going to go in here, as
well.

25
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:04,084
Now for the exact ingredients and recipe,
please go to my website. It's

26
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:08,753
there I list it for you. A little bit of garlic
powder, and then I'm going

27
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,040
to go ahead and stir this together a little
bit, before I put in my pickled

28
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,075
jalapeno slices.

29
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:19,082
I like to use the pickled ones, simply because
they're not as raw-tasting,

30
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:25,082
and I think the heat's a little bit more consistent.
So if you like your

31
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:29,148
cheese dip a little spicier, hey, add some
more or even add some of that

32
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:35,085
jalapeno pickle juice. You can see how that's
rich and creamy and full of

33
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:40,119
goodies, so hey, there's Ro-Tel Cheese Dip
two different ways. And for more
