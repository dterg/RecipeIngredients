This is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.
I'm going to show you how you

2
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:10,074
can make a baked potato that's just like the
Outback Steakhouse, with that

3
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:15,213
wonderful salty crust on the outside, so let's
get started and solve this

4
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:16,840
mystery.

5
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:19,089
We're going to start out with baked potatoes,
now use as many as you like.

6
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:23,086
Now I'm using some that are roughly the size
of my hand. I'm guessing

7
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:28,132
that's about a half pound. You're going to
need some kosher salt, which you

8
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:33,043
can buy at your regular grocery store. If
you haven't tried it, it's a

9
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:37,079
great ingredient to use for salt, lots of
flavor.

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,158
We're going to use a vegetable oil. It doesn't
matter. You can use just

11
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:50,130
vegetable oil, sunflower, safflower, corn
oil. I would stay away from olive

12
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:54,096
oil and peanut oil, simply because I think
that can add a little extra

13
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:57,082
flavor that I'm not quite looking for here.

14
00:00:57,082 --> 00:01:01,145
Now you don't need to pierce your baked potato
with a fork or a knife or

15
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:09,045
anything. You're just going to dip a paper
towel into a small container and

16
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:17,044
just rub the whole potato down with oil. We're
doing this so the salt

17
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:21,146
crust will stick on it, and this does another
thing, as well.

18
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:26,111
It keeps the potato nice and light and fluffy
in the inside, because we're

19
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:34,011
not losing any of the potato's natural water,
so it really works out well.

20
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:40,067
So by now you've preheated your oven to about
350 degrees. It's heating

21
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,254
away and it's getting ready for us.

22
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,330
The next thing we're going to do is we're
just sprinkle on some salt. Now

23
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:49,072
we're not going to wrap these in foil, because
this could knock off a

24
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:54,151
little bit of the salt, so that's it. We're
just going to sprinkle it with

25
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,950
salt. Then we're going to pop it into our
350 degree oven.

26
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:01,944
I'm going to bake these until they're done,
and for me that takes about an

27
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,490
hour, so probably close to an hour for you
as well. Go head, put these in

28
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,137
the oven, and then take them back out. Let
them cool for a little bit, but

29
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:16,386
you can see the salty crust has remained.

30
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,755
These are wonderful, light, and fluffy on
the inside, so I want to show you

31
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:28,162
what this looks like a little bit closer.
How fabulous is that? That's

32
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:34,150
perfect. I love the underside, because it
browns just a little bit. It gets

33
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:38,084
a little big crispy on the bottom. I don't
think there's anything much

34
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:40,283
better than that.

35
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,090
So here we go, here's our baked potato. I'm
going to go ahead and cut this

36
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:49,358
open. You can see again, the salt stays right
on the top, to make it so

37
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,531
delicious. Now I'm going to ahead and prepare
this baked potato. Now of

38
00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:00,381
course, it's still screaming hot, so use a
towel. Use something other than

39
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:06,840
your fingers at this point, because burning
yourself before dinner is never

40
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,151
fun.

41
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,570
What comes next? Well, of course, we're going
to top our baked potato with

42
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:17,900
our favorite ingredients of our choice. I'm
a butter and sour cream, kind

43
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:23,017
of girl, but as you can see these are really
easy to do. You just need a

44
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:29,917
baked potato, a little bit of vegetable oil.
Again, your choice is fine,

45
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,806
and some kosher salt.

46
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:38,150
That's like the potato, the non-negotiable
ingredient, and we're going to

47
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:42,814
bake these. They take about an hour in a 350
degree oven and that's it. How

48
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:47,040
wonderful is that? So here we go, we're topping
our baked potato with a

49
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:53,026
little bit of butter, sour cream, and chives,
and that's how you can make a

50
00:03:53,026 --> 00:04:00,026
baked potato, just like they do at the Outback
Steakhouse. Don't forget to
