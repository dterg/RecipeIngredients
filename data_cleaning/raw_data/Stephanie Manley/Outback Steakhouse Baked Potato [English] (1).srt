this is Stephanie manly with copycat dot
com

2
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:08,062
I'm gonna show you how you can make at
baked potato that's just like the

3
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:09,087
Outback Steakhouse

4
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:12,156
without a wonderful salty crust on the
outside I'm

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:17,675
from let's get started and solve this
mystery we're gonna start out with baked

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:18,253
potatoes

7
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,988
now use as many as you like now I'm
using some that are roughly the size of

8
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:25,240
my hand I'm guessing that's about a
half-pound

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:30,090
you're going to need some kosher salt
which you can buy it a regular grocery

10
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:30,065
store

11
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:34,055
I'm he haven't read it is a great
ingredient

12
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,512
on to use for salt them what the flavor

13
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,230
and for good news a vegetable oil

14
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:44,025
it doesn't matter you can you lose

15
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:48,104
just vegetable oil sunflower safflower
arm

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,750
corn oil I would stay away from olive
oil in peanut oil

17
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,204
simply because they think they can add a
little extra flavor

18
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,010
that I'm not quite looking for here they
don't need the pure sure baked potato

19
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,007
with the four

20
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,046
or in ninety for anything you're just
going to

21
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:07,065
arm Dept a paper towel

22
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:12,174
into a small container and as rob the
hall potato down

23
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,920
with oil you and number two in this

24
00:01:15,092 --> 00:01:18,100
those so the salt crust will stick on it

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,002
arm in this does another thing as well

26
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:28,007
he keeps patino nice in light in fluffy
in the inside because we're not losing

27
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:31,068
any arm other potatoes National Water

28
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:37,167
so would really works out well so by now
you preheat your oven about 350 degrees

29
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,366
in its heating away and getting ready
for us

30
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,970
and the next thing gonna do use words
can sprinkle on some salt

31
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,930
now we're not corrupt isn't Boyle
because this could knock off a little

32
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,093
bit at the Salt

33
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:54,212
arm so that's it we're just gonna
sprinkle it was thought they were gonna

34
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,570
pop it in a 350 degree oven

35
00:01:57,057 --> 00:02:00,536
I'm going to bake these until they're
done

36
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,056
in for me that takes about an hour so
probably close to an hour for you as

37
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:05,680
well

38
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:08,867
to go ahead put these in the oven and
then take them back out

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,370
let him cool for a little bit armpit you
can see

40
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:17,080
the salty crossed has remade in these
are wonderful

41
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:22,053
light and fluffy on the inside so I
wanna show you what the folks up

42
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:26,086
like a little bit closer how fabulous is
that

43
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:30,098
that perfect and um I love

44
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:34,144
the underside because the brown just a
little bit a little bit crispy on the

45
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:35,108
bottom

46
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:40,027
I don't think there's a anything much
better than that um

47
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,141
so here we go here's our paper tale I'm
gonna go ahead

48
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,566
and cut the soap and you can see again
this fall

49
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,090
stays right on the top to make it so
delicious

50
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:54,488
now i dnt go ahead and prepare this big
potato

51
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,010
now of course it still screaming hot so

52
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:02,053
use it how these something other than
your fingers at this point because

53
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:05,842
burning your stop for dinner is never

54
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,810
never find so what comes next well

55
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:12,114
of course we're going to topper pay
potato with the

56
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:18,022
favorite ingredients for choice home and
the butter and sour cream kinda girl

57
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:21,028
home but as you can see these are really

58
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:24,065
really easy to do you just need 8 big
potato

59
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:27,120
you need um alleged

60
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:32,821
oil again your choice is fine in some
kosher salt that's than

61
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,080
you know like the potato the
non-negotiable ingredient and

62
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:41,197
arm we can debate the easy take about an
hour in 3 MPT decree Evan

63
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,272
and that's it how wonderful is that so
