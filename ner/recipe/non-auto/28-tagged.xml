This is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.<s>
I'm going to show you how you can make a baked potato that's just like the Outback Steakhouse, with that wonderful salty crust on the outside, so let's get started and solve this mystery.<s>
We're going to start out with baked <B-Ingredient>potatoes</B-Ingredient>, now use as many as you like.<s>
Now I'm using some that are roughly the size of my hand.<s>
I'm guessing that's about a <B-Amount>half</B-Amount> <B-Unit>pound</B-Unit>.<s>
You're going to need <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>kosher</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>salt</I-Ingredient>, which you can buy at your regular grocery store.<s>
If you haven't tried it, it's a great ingredient to use for salt, lots of flavor.<s>
We're going to use a <B-Ingredient>vegetable</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient>.<s>
It doesn't matter.<s>
You can use just <B-Ingredient>vegetable</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient>, sunflower, safflower, <B-Ingredient>corn</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient>.<s>
I would stay away from <B-Ingredient>olive</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient> and <B-Ingredient>peanut</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient>, simply because I think that can add a little extra flavor that I'm not quite looking for here.<s>
Now you don't need to pierce your baked potato with a fork or a knife or anything.<s>
You're just going to dip a paper towel into a small container and just rub the whole potato down with <B-Ingredient>oil</B-Ingredient>.<s>
We're doing this so the salt crust will stick on it, and this does another thing, as well.<s>
It keeps the potato nice and light and fluffy in the inside, because we're not losing any of the potato's natural water, so it really works out well.<s>
So by now you've preheated your oven to about 350 degrees.<s>
It's heating away and it's getting ready for us.<s>
The next thing we're going to do is we're just sprinkle on <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Now we're not going to wrap these in foil, because this could knock off a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of the <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient>, so that's it.<s>
We're just going to sprinkle it with <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient>.<s>
Then we're going to pop it into our 350 degree oven.<s>
I'm going to bake these until they're done, and for me that takes about an hour, so probably close to an hour for you as well.<s>
Go head, put these in the oven, and then take them back out.<s>
Let them cool for a little bit, but you can see the salty crust has remained.<s>
These are wonderful, light, and fluffy on the inside, so I want to show you what this looks like a little bit closer.<s>
How fabulous is that?<s>
That's perfect.<s>
I love the underside, because it browns just a little bit.<s>
It gets a little big crispy on the bottom.<s>
I don't think there's anything much better than that.<s>
So here we go, here's our baked potato.<s>
I'm going to go ahead and cut this open.<s>
You can see again, the <B-Ingredient>salt</B-Ingredient> stays right on the top, to make it so delicious.<s>
Now I'm going to ahead and prepare this baked potato.<s>
Now of course, it's still screaming hot, so use a towel.<s>
Use something other than your fingers at this point, because burning yourself before dinner is never fun.<s>
What comes next?<s>
Well, of course, we're going to top our baked potato with our favorite ingredients of our choice.<s>
I'm a <B-Ingredient>butter</B-Ingredient> and <B-Ingredient>sour</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>cream</I-Ingredient>, kind of girl, but as you can see these are really easy to do.<s>
You just need a baked <B-Ingredient>potato</B-Ingredient>, <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>vegetable</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>oil</I-Ingredient>.<s>
Again, your choice is fine, and <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>kosher</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>salt</I-Ingredient>.<s>
That's like the <B-Ingredient>potato</B-Ingredient>, the non-negotiable ingredient, and we're going to bake these.<s>
They take about an hour in a 350 degree oven and that's it.<s>
How wonderful is that?<s>
So here we go, we're topping our baked <B-Ingredient>potato</B-Ingredient> with <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>butter</B-Ingredient>, <B-Ingredient>sour</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>cream</I-Ingredient>, and <B-Ingredient>chives</B-Ingredient>, and that's how you can make a baked potato, just like they do at the Outback Steakhouse.<s>
