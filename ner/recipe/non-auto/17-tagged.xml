Hi guys, Jillian Beck here.<s>
Welcome to my kitchen.<s>
Today I will be showing you my Thai beef salad.<s>
It takes about, probably 20 minute to assemble.<s>
It's super easy.<s>
It's great for summer.<s>
It's getting warmer out and I kind of tend to go with salads around this time of year, grilled proteins are excellent, the fresher, the better.<s>
So this Thai salad is amazing because it's got tons of herbs, a lot of favors, some grilled steak, which is always a winner in my book, and then a lot of great flavors that are very typical of Thai dishes.<s>
As you may know, I do like Asian food and flavors if you've followed any of my other recipes.<s>
I just think it's a really good way to add flavor without adding a ton of calories and fat and all that other junk that comes with like a lot of sauces and condiments that some other recipes call for.<s>
So I've kind of pre-made things here so it goes by a little quicker for you guys.<s>
I'll kind of show you what you're going to need for this recipe.<s>
First and foremost, you need a lean steak.<s>
I typically go with sirloin.<s>
I'll trim the fat away from it or I'll go with a flank steak.<s>
So we've grilled that on the Foreman here.<s>
If you have an outdoor grill, by all means use that.<s>
In my apartment, we don't have a grill yet so I either go to my friends house to, you know, grill on the barbecue or use the Foreman.<s>
So I've gone ahead and I've grilled it to my liking, which is about medium rare.<s>
So grill it to the temperature that you prefer.<s>
And I've sliced it so about 4 ounces sliced for one salad.<s>
We've got our mixed greens here, <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>mixed</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>red</I-Ingredient> lettuces and green lettuces and then we have our fresh herbs.<s>
We've got basil, mint, <B-Ingredient>green</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>onion</I-Ingredient> and <B-Ingredient>cilantro</B-Ingredient>.<s>
So those are the components of the salad and I'm gonna show you how to make the dressing and then we'll put it all together.<s>
So for the dressing what you're going to need is fresh <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>juice</I-Ingredient>, which I've already gone ahead and squeezed.<s>
So we have <B-Amount>2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>tablespoons</B-Unit> of fresh <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient>.<s>
We're going to add <B-Amount>1</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of low-sodium soy sauce.<s>
So I'll go ahead and add that right now.<s>
Here we go.<s>
And then we're going to use <B-Ingredient>fish</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>sauce</I-Ingredient> and it's just a typical Asian flavor.<s>
You can find it in the Asian market in most of your grocery stores and if you can't, maybe go to like your local Asian market to find it, but it's a pretty strong flavor but it's good.<s>
It's just a little goes a long ways.<s>
So we're gonna put 2--yeah, <B-Amount>2</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoons</B-Unit> in here along with the <B-Amount>1</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>soy</B-Ingredient> and then the <B-Ingredient>lime</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>juice</I-Ingredient>.<s>
And then we're gonna go ahead and add lemongrass.<s>
Now you can get fresh lemongrass from the produce aisle and slice it and add it to the salad along with all the other herbs.<s>
My grocer didn't have that so I went ahead and got the lemongrass paste.<s>
So I'll go ahead and add that as well and we'll just do about half a teaspoon, just a really small squeeze of that.<s>
And usually with Asian dressings and what not, they--you need to add like <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>sugar</B-Ingredient> or <B-Ingredient>honey</B-Ingredient> or <B-Ingredient>agave</B-Ingredient> for like the sweetness to round all the flavors out.<s>
Typically I have been using <B-Ingredient>Stevia</B-Ingredient> in the raw so that's what I'm gonna use here today but feel free to use whatever sweetener you choose, if that's honey, if that's <B-Ingredient>agave</B-Ingredient>, <B-Ingredient>brown</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>sugar</I-Ingredient>, whatever it is that you want, go ahead and add that to the dressing.<s>
For me, I like I said, I just need it a tad bit sweet and so I've been using <B-Ingredient>Stevia</B-Ingredient> in the raw.<s>
So I'll just do like half <B-Amount>a</B-Amount> <B-Unit>teaspoon</B-Unit> of that as well.<s>
And then I'm gonna mix all those ingredients up for our dressing and let the lemongrass dissolve a little bit.<s>
And I'm also gonna add the green <B-Ingredient>onions</B-Ingredient> to the dressing as well to kind of soak up the flavors of that.<s>
It smells really good, really fresh.<s>
Okay, so we'll go ahead and start to plate.<s>
We'll just put the sliced steak on top of the salad here.<s>
Just lay it on there.<s>
And you can actually garnish it with all these fresh herbs before you put the steak, but I kind of messed that one up but it doesn't really matter 'cause you're gonna mix it all together anyways.<s>
So I'll put the mint and the basil and you've got your steak there.<s>
And we'll go ahead and top it with the dressing.<s>
Pour it all over.<s>
And if you want a little more spice, feel free to add like <B-Amount>some</B-Amount> <B-Ingredient>red</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>chili</I-Ingredient> flakes would be really good.<s>
Chili paste would be good if you wanted to add that as well.<s>
And then we're gonna garnish it with a little <B-Unit>bit</B-Unit> of <B-Ingredient>cilantro</B-Ingredient> on top.<s>
So there you have it.<s>
Really simple, really fresh and easy but a ton of flavor.<s>
And there you have it, my Thai beef steak salad.<s>
There you go.<s>
I hope you guys enjoy.<s>
Thank you so much.<s></transcript></transcripts>
