a great item you can meet for your breakfast now so for today's recipe these are the ingredients are going going to you and we have dry ingredients and wet ingredients organic separately cell for dry

this is no sugar added or natural apple sauce and the most important thing you can do is read the ingredients list so try to find one that all ingredients are <B-Ingredient>apples</B-Ingredient> in

gotten lazy and not make that together very well and my <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> doesn't evenly distributes and then when it could have a bit kenna if flatter than the rest I just wanna make sure the sentiment is gets evenly distributed in the <B-Ingredient>baking</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> interest until you can see anymore you know brown spots are white spots isn't it looks nice unmixed out this looks pretty good finance at the set aside and then mexico are wet ingredients and doesn't really matter what order rent-a-car

spatula to get it all out and then we're gonna put interact with now little trick I learned I use it just for my <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> in the trash can and for some reason I cannot figure out why my house found that out time and then one day I want to go take out the trash and it was rose I could tell a great for <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yolk</I-Ingredient> for seeping through the bottom in the trash bag and my we realize that it was because I was eating so many <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> reference only and get some trash can and so now I just throw them in the garbage disposal that way it doesn't think upper half I know some people have dogs actually let their dogs ether <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yolks</I-Ingredient> and it's good for their coats but you have any pets %uh to see the garbage disposal house one you also could do the <B-Ingredient>liquid</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>egg whites</I-Ingredient> if you wanna that are come in a carton to sling trees a little bit less than than ratio calls for me think now I'm gonna take my mistake my Wes can just makes us all together really well sometimes birth egg white skin kinda stick together a little bit sound slick centel it looks nice and unmixed then we're gonna bring over my Nick starring gradients you were just going to combine the and stern altogether have a two-year-old and this is his favorite part I let him usually do you this fine cutting up the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> or from handle him cut the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> with me kinda fun to get the kids involved with this recipe it's also a really healthy male you get your your kids to get some whole grains into your diet rights another that's makes women prepare RPN to the side in risk amuse and agent spy p.m. you could use a 9-inch pie pan as well if you're happy and you could even just use a a square castro this men just really lightly spray and I don't use a lot of the stuff but I just use the nonstick cooking spray and take a cutting board you were gonna take one for bananas and we're just gonna slice a relief then can if Houston pretty thin slices because you want another banana slices that you can wear the entire bottom obtain now finance and turn color after they've been exposed to the air and so know always but sometimes I neighbors does performer and if I let said the fridge for a couple days it kenna turns on with her a purplish color stuff that happens to you don't be alarm that's not there's nothing wrong with its just because the banana once they get exposed to the area they can change color so now what I'm doing is undertaking the banana slices and lining the bottom other p.m. and after I'm done whining this then we're gonna pour the batter on top but the main so they say when you bite into it you have banana taste on the bottom and they were gonna put another way opinion is on the top alright so this looks pretty good now what we're gonna do is pour the batter on top of the banana means just evenly distributed there gonna sell the pana all the way to the edge men just screen about the rest honor and then what we're going to do is slice our second banana we're gonna do the same things are going to put a nice where <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> on top and not only does this make it taste good but it also exodus really pretty so the ferry slice rebellion is the more you're gonna be able to put across can in this recipe makes 4 servings so one serving really just has one egg lay a scooper of <B-Ingredient>protein</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>powder</I-Ingredient> and have a couple votes plus a little bit <B-Ingredient>Greek</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>yogurt</I-Ingredient> a little bit on the milk it does have half a banana on a little bit %uh spices so this is a really good option for breakfast in if you kinda getting tired of just regular old <B-Ingredient>egg</B-Ingredient> <I-Ingredient>whites</I-Ingredient> and you okay so and distribute the very evenly some military inskeep from these <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> over XP and then wanna do is take my <B-Ingredient>strawberries</B-Ingredient> and again I'm gonna slice pays family then can you don't have to at history's if you don't you know if you don't have them you can just do the <B-Ingredient>bananas</B-Ingredient> and I say about this recipe is it's really versatile to you really could use any kind for I've done this

<B-Ingredient>strawberries</B-Ingredient> on top like that yeah i four before serve reserve five star Bruce and just too so it's not like that self that say I'm we have other merit preheated the oven to 375 degrees some realistic this and other than and we are going to cook it for about forty to forty-five minutes basically the top is going to be a golden brown and you know it's done once you put a knife in the center and the knife comes out clean of right side effects %uh then we could differ forty-five minutes of and I'm just gonna test it to make sure that the knife comes out clean looks pretty good and as you can see the top %uh this is going to be kind of a golden brown color in what I'm gonna do is let it sit here and rest for between five to 10 minutes just until it cools if I tried to cut into it now it would also give collapse together sir gonna let it cool and set for about five to ten minutes and then after that I will cut it into fourths one serving is one wage say I just usually just use a butter knife handcuffed Throop mmm sometimes like to take my knife and ran it along the fly just in case so doesn't stick premiums can take a serving his home phone pull out 11
