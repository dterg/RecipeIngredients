pitted am Highland and how it looking like I'm in a brand new kitchen so long orange carrot top hello friend house with white cabinets and not natural light and looks like rich people in here so I'm gonna make some Greek pasta salad today this is a great thing for our summertime potlucks father's Day is coming out maybe nothing to take out for that and then after we make the recipe and I give you act or our new house and tell you a little bit about this one around the eight way that thinker hosokawa doesn't need to cook sound pasta now one thing I've been in touch about am I've got about a quart of water almost to a boil here you really don't need to use like six quarts water when you're making pasta Arabic thing about water conservation online website if you want to go reading tips now has a wire because it's our most precious natural resource an I said that sarcastically but I mean it so anyway me about a quart of water to cook two cups the past hour half a pound which is what we're gonna do now them reason that people tell you to use whole shit on water like that is so that the positive thing together but as long as your class standing here for the first minute or so while the pasta goes then you can stir it around a little bit then it's not gonna stick together some absence of my water so basically just last yr until it comes back to well it'll take 30 seconds to a minute you can put the lid back on for maybe 10 or 15 seconds to help it come back to work faster but don't walk off because it will while or if you do that so want well I want to set the timer my pasta package said nine to 11 minutes spot the difference which is 10 and then subtract two to set it for eight-minute edit guess I've got my dreams while that's boiling comes gonna go ahead and when a snap to but also demands of the is I don't bother like snapping of the little string and because I think they're kinda cute so once you've got all year green beans snapped just travel all India about one-inch link now said Amanda Salam Paul getting the hell outta my way once our timer goes off which is just in about two minutes man and the green beans and then let the pasta and a green beans boiled together for the last two minutes that's gonna sorta blanche to green beans and let the pasta finish cooking then you just wanna drain the pasta and green beans and give them a quick grounds for some cold water not return a call of so much as you are just trying to rinse off the excess starch they'll stick together miners leave those training and think why did this other stuff kinda propped up said got some fresh parsley I'm not gonna be to an all about like not leaving any stands behind no stomach when I'm to serve pull off two big leaves we're gonna give it a rough chops just sorta wat up into a little ball and don't put your fingers and then I've got some kalamata olives and already chopped up some sweet peppers and some tomatoes here as you can see you you can buy a pre sliced kalamata olives but I find that they get a little bit mushy so I like to buy the ones that are just petted and Hall and then was gonna cut in half yeah let's just cut in half that's easier for everyone still me I'm you work aren't that dressing so that's gonna require clove garlic this commitment up then in a all here gonna her this Carla see if I can do this and to got my girl in a large bowl of Madea olive oil about 2 tablespoons that nah nah nah son white wine vinegar you can use red wine vinegar you can use cider vinegar someone at a couple to listen to this and traditional vinaigrette is three-part well to one part accent like vinegar and lemon juice I like mine a little bit more forceful like me then a great to really take control so I'm gonna do one to one ratio but feel for you in just a little bit according to your taste attack next to her and some black pepper port salts and the real kicker here some haranguing now and that's what makes the creek nada whole teaspoon get that next start now let me to grab the have to just down that on i Mees wouldn't spend China hurt your delegate years sweet viewers to and talk with all around 19 at are other vegetables and you know whatever else you want to add to this cucumbers many here red onion whatever have a pasta party so this is why to when you making pasta for pasta salad you wanna under could get just a tiny tiny bit take out he just moments before it would be tender enough to serve hot because they want to call it off annex you're gonna credits can absorb sound that vinaigrette and a makes it way too much as it has some room to absorb some that also it would be release on the issue could it completely before you did that so then once everything's mixed up together it's cooled off organ and the last thing I want you to limit you are being in or you can use some parmesan cheese and sent to you and that some crumbled fettuccine just a little bit couple table stand there we have it weren't done to get service right now at room temperature or you can refrigerate it and last in the fridge for a couple a days metaphor can only eat it actor if you like this recipe also did a potato salad and last year so that's also a really great and call larger than a great cole slaw that's also good because I am an answer sitting out front row out time and again I like poisonous on you know kill your
