the that %uh %uh %uh %uh mom %uh are hi I'm same even in for gay and the bottling up counting excited to show you how tiny cinnamon swirl affecting back it's where my favorite things I can use as a snack and meal because it's got your healthy carbs and a healthy protein so let's get started first thing you're gonna want to do is preheat your oven to 350 degrees the next thing I did was I got Mike and ready this is after eight by eight inspire Xth I just a light little non-stick spray and you can set that aside and then I got all my ingredients together and for this I want a large bowl for my dry ingredients and a small table for my wedding gradients so the first ingredient I'm using is ok flower in a supermarket this is what helps lower looks like now I'm often asked if this is gluten-free and ot oats typically are gluten-free but one thing to note is that unless it doesn't indicated on the bag you never really sure is maybe it was cross-contaminated in processing so for this one it doesn't indicate gluten-free that for the most part oats are but if you're concerned be sure to look for that indication unlabeled if you can't find its new supermarket you can actually make your down you can use a coffee grinder in just ran a little bit at a time or you could use a blender just make sure to know that sometimes you can't get it as finely ground as what's in the package seem I have to increase the amount you're using for the rescue and the slides ball I've added a cap and a half though far and to that I'm gonna add as an hour away protein now you can use whichever one you practice to skips in here make sure to know that that different flavors and from the different manufactures will make them taste different me so I want to use one that has as few ingredients and it is possible the cleaner the better summit damn fat and smile flower and then said that I'm gonna at it myself now if you use a letting agent like baking soda or baking powder he usually need salt because that makes it react add those in and then to this dry ingredient batter I mean actually add 1/4 cup stevia this is what's TVL looks like at the supermarket i'm steve is a great national sweetener because it's no calorie has no car I don't typically use just stevia around two sweet my recipes because it can be kinda better there's different brands st. Viator stevia and there's another raincoat trivia trivia is a great option to that is typically more expensive there's two sides to the stevia plant this one tends to be slightly more better it is cheaper and trivia usually see in packets are in a little tiny tent for baking forgoing the cheap route today that's it for dry ingredients we do have these two other ingredients used the extra special ones that just make it actually ami dorgan eases later something to eat this aside to get me my list just like the CEP really well let's try get that baking powder on top rated sometimes if you don't want fake evenly think that skin Somerset that's what I and get this smaller bowl ready for my wedding the ants for the wet ingredients bringing me to egg whites you can see he's a whole egg if your knees a whole egg but I prefer to minimize the fat and payments and USPS I can do that my second eg if he ever drop be ok in there indices the same shell is the shit out it comes right out so dropped funny and shoe the eggs I'm gonna had one jar as ABC applesauce he can use regular after soft but what are the reasons I like and the baby food brand is there's typically no additives as long as you read the label there's no additives and it's nice and forcing portion controlled so out open at get all the good stuff off the top can skip this out again just unsweetened applesauce and from the jar that works just like that's my additional sweetener one of them to the stevia which actually will cut some that bitterness next thing I had is gonna be my yogurt and I cheese Greek yogurt because Greek yogurt actually has less sugar and has added protein so I only need a half a container this some rescue cats can add some moisture to spread said babysit applesauce and yogurt actually replace the butter and oil in a traditional recipe saw at that and then for a substitute for milk I'm using my and sweetened almond breeze now on NBC again I like this better than say so we or rights not because it has again added protein so it's just more nutritious and it's healthy fats so at that meeting about a cat and spot it through and ingredients Surekha my happening around really taste interested take really get again one of my favorite you can actually make s and any candidate I it's like we're gonna do we can get in a traditional left and now they have mixed on the wet ingredients and add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients so get my large ball back now and get my little rubber spatula so I can get all the wet ingredients as their choice great the ball more moisture the vatican cannot be icing my niece and and stay that way not get right out so added the lets the dry an expat see you want it to be.<s>
