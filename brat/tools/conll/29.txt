Eugenie Kitchen Hi, I am Eugenie.<s>
Today I am going to make "Soufflé à la vanille", vanilla Soufflé.<s>
Soufflé, it puffs up in the oven and it falls down so quickly.<s>
So, there is a famous French saying, “Le souffle n’attend pas, on attend le soufflé.” That means le soufflé doesn’t wait for us, we (the guests) wait for le soufflé.<s>
But today we will not wait for le soufflé, we will make  the soufflé.<s>
For this recipe, you will need: 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (14g), 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour ( 10g), 1 /2 cup of milk (120 ml), 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons of caster sugar (30g), 2 eggs, and a pinch of salt.<s>
First, with butter at room-temperature, brush the ramekins.<s>
Brush from bottom upwards.<s>
This will make the soufflé to rise evenly.<s>
Then, with caster sugar coat the ramekins.<s>
And shake out any excess.<s>
And set aside.<s>
On medium heat, add the butter in the sauce pan and melt it.<s>
Add in the flour and with a wooden spoon stir for about 1 minute.<s>
In the microwave, I made the milk hot.<s>
Out of the heat, gradually add hot milk, and stir until smooth and combined.<s>
Back to medium heat stir constantly until it comes to a boil.<s>
Remove from the heat.<s>
The texture should be like this.<s>
This is white sauce.<s>
Now add in salt and vanilla extract and stir until combined.<s>
Separate the egg white and egg yolk.<s>
Then add in the egg yolks one by one into white sauce and stir to combine.<s>
The sauce pan is still warm, so pour the sauce into a separate bowl to prevent unwanted evaporation.<s>
And set aside.<s>
Now, whisk egg whites.<s>
It is not mixing.<s>
It is incorporating the air like this.<s>
Keep whisking until firm peaks form.<s>
Add gradually sugar while slowly whisking.<s>
Keep whisking until soft peaks form.<s>
This is French meringue.<s>
It takes about 20 minutes with hand.<s>
Then, add about one third of the French meringue into the white sauce and whisk until homogeneous.<s>
Then, pour all white sauce into meringue and whisk until just combined.<s>
Now, spoon the mixture into ramekin.<s>
Run thumb around inside of the rim.<s>
This will help the soufflé to rise straight.<s>
Bake at 390 degrees F (200 C.) for 12 to 15 minutes or until very well risen.<s>
Immediately serve on a plate.<s>
And dust with confectioners' sugar.<s>
soufflé... Risen straight and evenly.<s>
And it has golden brown top and pale yellow inside.<s>
This is classic French soufflé.<s>
It is very delicate and hot mousse.<s>
Thank you for watching!<s>
Bye for now.<s>
